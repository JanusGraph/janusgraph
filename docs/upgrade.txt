== Upgrade Instructions

Please follow these instructions when upgrading from Titan or an older
JanusGraph release.

=== Upgrading from Titan

JanusGraph is based on the latest commit to the `titan11` branch of
https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan[Titan repo].

JanusGraph has made the following changes to Titan, so you will need to adjust
your code and configuration accordingly:

. module names: `titan-*` are now `janusgraph-*`
. package names: `com.thinkaurelius.titan` are now `org.janusgraph`
. class names: `Titan*` are now `JanusGraph*` except in cases where this would
  duplicate a word, e.g., `TitanGraph` is simply `JanusGraph` rather than
  `JanusGraphGraph`

*IMPORTANT* If you are pointing JanusGraph at an existing Titan database you will
need to set the `graph.titan-version` property. For more information on how to
configure JanusGraph to read data which had previously been written by Titan
refer to <<migrating-titan>>.
