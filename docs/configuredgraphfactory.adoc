[[configuredgraphfactory]]
== ConfiguredGraphFactory

The JanusGraph Server can be configured to use the `ConfiguredGraphFactory`.
The `ConfiguredGraphFactory` is an access point to your graphs, similar
to the `JanusGraphFactory`. These graph factories provide methods for
dynamically managing the graphs hosted on the server.

[[overview]]
=== Overview

`JanusGraphFactory` is a class that provides an access point to your
graphs by providing a Configuration object each time you access the graph.

`ConfiguredGraphFactory` provides an access point to your graphs for which
you have previously created configurations using the
`ConfigurationManagementGraph`. It also offers an access point to manage
graph configurations.

`ConfigurationManagementGraph` allows you to manage graph configurations.

`JanusGraphManager` is an internal server component that tracks
graph references, provided your graphs are configured to use it.

[[configuredgraphfactory-versus-JanusGraphfactory]]
=== ConfiguredGraphFactory versus JanusGraphFactory

However, there is an important distinction between these two graph
factories:

1.  The `ConfiguredGraphFactory` can only be used if you have configured
your server to use the `ConfigurationManagementGraph` APIs at server
start.

The benefits of using the `ConfiguredGraphFactory` are that:

1.  You only need to supply a `String` to access your graphs, as opposed
to the `JanusGraphFactory`-- which requires you to specify information
about the backend you wish to use when accessing a graph-- every time
you open a graph.

2.  If your ConfigurationManagementGraph is configured with a distributed
storage backend then your graph configurations are available to all
JanusGraph nodes in your cluster.

[[how-does-the-configuredgraphfactory-work]]
=== How Does the ConfiguredGraphFactory Work?

The `ConfiguredGraphFactory` provides an access point to graphs under
two scenarios:

1.  You have already created a configuration for your specific graph
object using the `ConfigurationManagementGraph#createConfiguration`. In
this scenario, your graph is opened using the previously created
configuration for this graph.
2.  You have already created a template configuration using the
`ConfigurationManagementGraph#createTemplateConfiguration`. In this
scenario, we create a configuration for the graph you are creating by
copying over all attributes stored in your template configuration and
appending the relevant graphName attribute, and we then open the graph
according to that specific configuration.

[[accessing-the-graphs]]
=== Accessing the Graphs

You can either use `ConfiguredGraphFactory.create("graphName")`
or `ConfiguredGraphFactory.open("graphName")`. Learn more about the difference
between these two options by reading the section below about the `ConfigurationManagementGraph`.

You can also access your graphs by using the bindings. Read more about this in the <<graph-and-traversal-bindings>> section.

[[listing-the-graphs]]
=== Listing the Graphs

`ConfiguredGraphFactory.getGraphNames()` will return a set of graph names
for which you have created configurations using the `ConfigurationManagementGraph` APIs.

`JanusGraphFactory.getGraphNames()` on the other hand returns a set of graph names
for which you have instantiated _and_ the references are stored inside the `JanusGraphManager`.

[[dropping-a-graph]]
=== Dropping a Graph

`ConfiguredGraphFactory.drop("graphName")` will drop the graph database, deleting all data in storage and indexing backends. The graph can be open or closed (will be closed as part of the drop operation). Furthermore, this will also remove any existing graph configuration in the `ConfigurationManagementGraph`.

IMPORTANT: This is an irreversible operation that will delete all graph and index data.

IMPORTANT: To ensure all graph representations are consistent across all JanusGraph nodes in your cluster, this removes the graph from the `JanusGraphManager` graph cache on every node in the cluster, assuming each node has been properly configured to use the `JanusGraphManager`. Learn more about this feature and how to configure your server to use said feature <<multinodejanusgraphcluster.adoc#graph-reference-consistency, here>>.

[[configuring-JanusGraph-server-for-configuredgraphfactory]]
=== Configuring JanusGraph Server for ConfiguredGraphFactory

To be able to use the `ConfiguredGraphFactory`, you must configure your
server to use the `ConfigurationManagementGraph` APIs. To do this, you
have to inject a graph variable named "ConfigurationManagementGraph" in your
server's YAML's `graphs` map. For example:

[source, properties]
----
graphManager: org.janusgraph.graphdb.management.JanusGraphManager
graphs: {
  ConfigurationManagementGraph: conf/JanusGraph-configurationmanagement.properties
}
----

In this example, our `ConfigurationManagementGraph` graph will be
configured using the properties stored inside
`conf/JanusGraph-configurationmanagement.properties`, which for
example, look like:

[source, properties]
----
gremlin.graph=org.janusgraph.core.JanusGraphFactory
storage.backend=cql
graph.graphname=ConfigurationManagementGraph
storage.hostname=127.0.0.1
----

Assuming the GremlinServer started successfully and the
`ConfigurationManagementGraph` was successfully instantiated, then all the
APIs available on the `ConfigurationManagementGraph` `Singleton` will
also act upon said graph. Furthermore, this is the graph that will be
used to access the configurations used to create/open graphs using the
`ConfiguredGraphFactory`.

IMPORTANT: The `pom.xml` included in the JanusGraph distribution lists this dependency as
optional, but the `ConfiguredGraphFactory` makes use of the `JanusGraphManager`,
which requires a declared dependency on the `org.apache.tinkerpop:gremlin-server`. So
if you run into `NoClassDefFoundError` errors, then be sure to update according to this
message.

[[configurationmanagementgraph]]
=== ConfigurationManagementGraph

The `ConfigurationManagementGraph` is a `Singleton` that allows you to
create/update/remove configurations that you can use to access your
graphs using the `ConfiguredGraphFactory`. See above on configuring your
server to enable use of these APIs.

IMPORTANT: The ConfiguredGraphFactory offers an access point to manage your
graph configurations managed by the `ConfigurationManagementGraph`, so instead
of acting upon the `Singleton` itself, you may act upon the corresponding
`ConfiguredGraphFactory` static methods. For example, you may use
`ConfiguredGraphFactory.removeTemplateConfiguration()` instead of
`ConfiguredGraphFactory.getInstance().removeTemplateConfiguration()`.

[[graph-configurations]]
==== Graph Configurations

The `ConfigurationManagementGraph` singleton allows you to create
configurations used to open specific graphs, referenced by the
`graph.graphname` property. For example:

[source, gremlin]
----
map = new HashMap<String, Object>();
map.put("storage.backend", "cql");
map.put("storage.hostname", "127.0.0.1");
map.put("graph.graphname", "graph1");
ConfiguredGraphFactory.createConfiguration(new MapConfiguration(map));
----

Then you could access this graph on any JanusGraph node using:

[source, gremlin]
----
ConfiguredGraphFactory.open("graph1");
----

[[template-configuration]]
==== Template Configuration

The `ConfigurationManagementGraph` also allows you to create one
template configuration, which you can use to create many graphs using
the same configuration template. For example:

[source, gremlin]
----
map = new HashMap<String, Object>();
map.put("storage.backend", "cql");
map.put("storage.hostname", "127.0.0.1");
ConfiguredGraphFactory.createTemplateConfiguration(new MapConfiguration(map));
----

After doing this, you can create graphs using the template
configuration:

[source, gremlin]
----
ConfiguredGraphFactory.create("graph2");
----

This method will first create a new configuration for "graph2" by
copying over all the properties associated with the template
configuration and storing it on a configuration for this specific graph.
This means that this graph can be accessed in, on any JanusGraph node,
in the future by doing:

[source, gremlin]
----
ConfiguredGraphFactory.open("graph2");
----

[[updating-configurations]]
==== Updating Configurations

All interactions with both the `JanusGraphFactory` and the
`ConfiguredGraphFactory` that interact with configurations that define
the property `graph.graphname` go through the `JanusGraphManager` which
keeps track of graph references created on the given JVM. Think of it as
a graph cache. For this reason:

IMPORTANT: Any updates to a graph configuration results in the eviction of the relevant graph from the graph cache on every node in the JanusGraph cluster, assuming each node has been configured properly to use the `JanusGraphManager`. Learn more about this feature and how to configure your server to use said feature <<multinodejanusgraphcluster.adoc#graph-reference-consistency, here>>.

Since graphs created using the template configuration first create a
configuration for that graph in question using a copy and create method,
this means that:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Any updates to a specific graph created using the template
configuration are not guaranteed to take effect on the specific graph
until:

1. The relevant configuration is removed: `ConfiguredGraphFactory.removeConfiguration("graph2");`
2. The graph is recreated using the template configuration: `ConfiguredGraphFactory.create("graph2");`
====

[[update-examples]]
==== Update Examples

1) We migrated our Cassandra data to a new server with a new
IP address:

[source, gremlin]
----
map = new HashMap();
map.put("storage.backend", "cql");
map.put("storage.hostname", "127.0.0.1");
map.put("graph.graphname", "graph1");
ConfiguredGraphFactory.createConfiguration(new
MapConfiguration(map));

g1 = ConfiguredGraphFactory.open("graph1");

// Update configuration
map = new HashMap();
map.put("storage.hostname", "10.0.0.1");
ConfiguredGraphFactory.updateConfiguration("graph1",
map);

// We are now guaranteed to use the updated configuration
g1 = ConfiguredGraphFactory.open("graph1");
----

2) We added an Elasticsearch node to our setup:

[source, gremlin]
----
map = new HashMap();
map.put("storage.backend", "cql");
map.put("storage.hostname", "127.0.0.1");
map.put("graph.graphname", "graph1");
ConfiguredGraphFactory.createConfiguration(new
MapConfiguration(map));

g1 = ConfiguredGraphFactory.open("graph1");

// Update configuration
map = new HashMap();
map.put("index.search.backend", "elasticsearch");
map.put("index.search.hostname", "127.0.0.1");
map.put("index.search.elasticsearch.transport-scheme", "http");
ConfiguredGraphFactory.updateConfiguration("graph1",
map);

// We are now guaranteed to use the updated configuration
g1 = ConfiguredGraphFactory.open("graph1");
----

3) Update a graph configuration that was created using a template configuration that has been updated:

[source, gremlin]
----
map = new HashMap();
map.put("storage.backend", "cql");
map.put("storage.hostname", "127.0.0.1");
ConfiguredGraphFactory.createTemplateConfiguration(new
MapConfiguration(map));

g1 = ConfiguredGraphFactory.create("graph1");

// Update template configuration
map = new HashMap();
map.put("index.search.backend", "elasticsearch");
map.put("index.search.hostname", "127.0.0.1");
map.put("index.search.elasticsearch.transport-scheme", "http");
ConfiguredGraphFactory.updateTemplateConfiguration(new
MapConfiguration(map));

// Remove Configuration
ConfiguredGraphFactory.removeConfiguration("graph1");

// Recreate
ConfiguredGraphFactory.create("graph1");
// Now this graph's configuration is guaranteed to be updated
----

[[JanusGraphmanager]]
=== JanusGraphManager

The `JanusGraphManager` is a `Singleton` adhering to the TinkerPop graphManager specifications.

In particular, the `JanusGraphManager` provides:

1. a coordinated mechanism by which to instantiate graph references on a given JanusGraph node
2. a graph reference tracker (or cache)

Any graph you create using the `graph.graphname` property will go through the `JanusGraphManager` and thus be instantiated in a coordinated fashion. The graph reference will also be placed in the graph cache on the JVM in question.

Thus, any graph you open using the `graph.graphname` property that has already been instantiated on the JVM in question will be retrieved from the graph cache.

This is why updates to your configurations require a few steps to guarantee correctness.

[[usingtheJanusGraphmanager]]
==== How To Use The JanusGraphManager


This is a new configuration option you can use when defining a property in your configuration that defines how to access a graph. All configurations that include this property will result in the graph instantiation happening through the `JanusGraphManager` (process explained above).

For backwards compatibility, any graphs that do not supply this parameter but supplied at server start in your graphs object in your .yaml file, these graphs will be bound through the JanusGraphManager denoted by their `key` supplied for that graph. For example, if your .yaml graphs object looks like:

[source, properties]
----
graphManager: org.janusgraph.graphdb.management.JanusGraphManager
graphs {
  graph1: conf/graph1.properties,
  graph2: conf/graph2.properties
}
----

but `conf/graph1.properties` and `conf/graph2.properties` do not include the property `graph.graphname`, then these graphs will be stored in the JanusGraphManager and thus bound in your gremlin script executions as `graph1` and `graph2`, respectively.


[[important]]
==== Important

For convenience, if your configuration used to open a graph specifies `graph.graphname`, but does not specify the backend's storage directory, tablename, or keyspacename, then the relevant parameter will automatically be set to the value of `graph.graphname`. However, if you supply one of those parameters, that value will always take precedence. And if you supply neither, they default to the configuration option's default value.

One special case is `storage.root` configuration option. This is a new configuration option used to specify the base of the directory that will be used for any backend requiring local storage directory access. If you supply this parameter, you must also supply the `graph.graphname` property, and the absolute storage directory will be equal to the value of the `graph.graphname` property appended to the value of the `storage.root` property.

Below are some example use cases:

1) Create a template configuration for my Cassandra backend such that each graph created using this configuration gets a unique keyspace equivalent to the `String` <graphName> provided to the factory:

[source, gremlin]
----
map = new HashMap();
map.put("storage.backend", "cql");
map.put("storage.hostname", "127.0.0.1");
ConfiguredGraphFactory.createTemplateConfiguration(new
MapConfiguration(map));

g1 = ConfiguredGraphFactory.create("graph1"); //keyspace === graph1
g2 = ConfiguredGraphFactory.create("graph2"); //keyspace === graph2
g3 = ConfiguredGraphFactory.create("graph3"); //keyspace === graph3
----

2) Create a template configuration for my BerkeleyJE backend such that each graph created using this configuration gets a unique storage directory equivalent to the "<storage.root>/<graph.graphname>":

[source, gremlin]
----
map = new HashMap();
map.put("storage.backend", "berkeleyje");
map.put("storage.root", "/data/graphs");
ConfiguredGraphFactory.createTemplateConfiguration(new
MapConfiguration(map));

g1 = ConfiguredGraphFactory.create("graph1"); //storage directory === /data/graphs/graph1
g2 = ConfiguredGraphFactory.create("graph2"); //storage directory === /data/graphs/graph2
g3 = ConfiguredGraphFactory.create("graph3"); //storage directory === /data/graphs/graph3
----

[[graph-and-traversal-bindings]]
=== Graph and Traversal Bindings

Graphs created using the ConfiguredGraphFactory are bound to the executor context on the Gremlin Server by the "graph.graphname" property, and the graph's traversal reference is bound to the context by "<graphname>_traversal". This means, on subsequent connections to the server after the first time you create/open a graph, you can access the graph and traversal references by the "<graphname>" and "<graphname>_traversal" properties.

Learn more about this feature and how to configure your server to use said feature <<multinodejanusgraphcluster.adoc#dynamic-graph-and-traversal-bindings, here>>.

IMPORTANT: If you are connected to a remote Gremlin Server using the Gremlin Console and a *sessioned* connection, then you will have to reconnect to the server to bind the variables. This is also true for any sessioned WebSocket connection.

IMPORTANT: The JanusGraphManager rebinds every graph stored on the ConfigurationManagementGraph (or those for which you have created configurations) every 20 seconds. This means your graph and traversal bindings for graphs created using the ConfigredGraphFactory will be available on all JanusGraph nodes with a maximum of a 20 second lag. It also means that a binding will still be available on a node after a server restart.

It is reccomended to use a sessioned connection when creating a Configured Graph Factory template. If a sessioned connection is not used the Configured Graph Factory Template creation must be sent to the server as a single line using semi-colons.
