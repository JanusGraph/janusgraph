== Building JanusGraph

To build JanusGraph you need http://git-scm.com/[git] and http://maven.apache.org/[Maven].

. Clone the https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph[JanusGraph repository from GitHub] to a local directory.
. In that directory, execute `mvn clean install`. This will build JanusGraph and run the internal test suite. The internal test suite has no external dependencies. Note, that running all test cases requires a significant amount of time. To skip the tests when building JanusGraph, execute `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
. For comprehensive test coverage, execute `mvn clean test -P comprehensive`. This will run additional test covering communication to external storage backends, performance tests and concurrency tests. The comprehensive test suite uses Cassandra and HBase as external databases and requires that Cassandra and HBase are installed. Note, that running the comprehensive test suite requires a significant amount of of time (> 1 hour).
