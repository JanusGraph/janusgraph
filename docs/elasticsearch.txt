== Elasticsearch

[quote, 'https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch/[Elasticsearch Overview]']
Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected. 

JanusGraph supports https://www.elastic.co/[Elasticsearch] as an index backend.  Here are some of the Elasticsearch features supported by JanusGraph:

* *Full-Text*: Supports all `Text` predicates to search for text properties that matches a given word, prefix or regular expression.
* *Geo*: Supports all `Geo` predicates to search for geo properties that are intersecting, within, disjoint to or contained in a given query geometry. Supports points, circles, boxes, lines and polygons for indexing. Supports circles, boxes and polygons for querying point properties and all shapes for querying non-point properties. Note that JTS is required when using line and polygon shapes (see <<search-predicates#geoshape,Geoshape documentation>> for more information).
* *Numeric Range*: Supports all numeric comparisons in `Compare`.
* *Flexible Configuration*: Supports embedded or remote operation, custom transport and discovery, and open-ended settings customization.
* *TTL*: Supports automatically expiring indexed elements.
* *Collections*: Supports indexing SET and LIST cardinality properties.
* *Temporal*: Nanosecond granularity temporal indexing.
* *Custom Analyzer*: Choose to use a custom analyzer

Please see <<version-compat>> for details on what versions of ES will work with JanusGraph.

===============================
Beginning with Elasticsearch 5.0 JanusGraph uses sandboxed https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/modules-scripting-painless.html[Painless scripts] for inline updates, which are enabled by default in Elasticsearch 5.x.

Using JanusGraph with Elasticsearch 2.x requires enabling Groovy inline scripting by setting `script.engine.groovy.inline.update` to `true` on the Elasticsearch cluster (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-scripting-security.html#enable-dynamic-scripting[dynamic scripting documentation] for more information).

=== Running Elasticsearch

JanusGraph supports connections to a running Elasticsearch cluster. JanusGraph provides two options for running local Elasticsearch instances for getting started quickly.  JanusGraph server (see <<basics#server-getting-started>>) automatically starts a local Elasticsearch instance. Alternatively JanusGraph releases include a full Elasticsearch distribution to allow users to manually start a local Elasticsearch instance (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/running-elasticsearch.html[this page] for more information).

For security reasons Elasticsearch must be run under a non-root account

=== Elasticsearch Configuration Overview

JanusGraph supports HTTP and Transport client connections to a running Elasticsearch cluster. Please see <<version-compat>> for details on what versions of ES will work with the different client types in JanusGraph.

[NOTE]
JanusGraph's index options start with the string "`index.[X].`" where "`[X]`" is a user-defined name for the backend.  This user-defined name must be passed to JanusGraph's ManagementSystem interface when building a mixed index, as described in <<index-mixed>>, so that JanusGraph knows which of potentially multiple configured index backends to use.  Configuration snippets in this chapter use the name `search`, whereas prose discussion of options typically write `[X]` in the same position.  The exact index name is not significant as long as it is used consistently in JanusGraph's configuration and when administering indices.

[TIP]
It's recommended that index names contain only alphanumeric lowercase characters and hyphens, and that they start with a lowercase letter.

==== Connecting to Elasticsearch

The Elasticsearch client is specified as follows:

[source, properties]
----
# ES REST client
index.search.elasticsearch.interface=REST_CLIENT
index.search.backend=elasticsearch
----

[source, properties]
----
# ES TransportClient
index.search.elasticsearch.interface=TRANSPORT_CLIENT
index.search.backend=elasticsearch
----

The `REST_CLIENT` and `TRANSPORT_CLIENT` values tell JanusGraph to use either the REST or Transport client, respectively.  One or the other must be specified.  Do not specify both in the same configuration.

When connecting to Elasticsearch a single or list of hostnames for the Elasticsearch instances must be provided.  These are supplied via JanusGraph's `index.[X].hostname` key.

[source, properties]
----
index.search.backend=elasticsearch
index.search.elasticsearch.interface=TRANSPORT_CLIENT
index.search.hostname=10.0.0.10:9300
----

Each host or host:port pair specified here will be added to the HTTP client's round-robin list of request targets.  Here's a minimal configuration that will round-robin over 10.0.0.10 on the default Elasticsearch HTTP port (9200) and 10.0.0.20 on port 7777:

[source, properties]
----
index.search.backend=elasticsearch
index.search.elasticsearch.interface=REST_CLIENT
index.search.hostname=10.0.0.10, 10.0.0.20:7777
----

Connection configuration options (see <<config-ref>>) are read in roughly the following steps:

. Any JanusGraph config options starting with `index.[X].elasticsearch.ext.`
. Any other ES-related JanusGraph config options listed in JanusGraph's config file


Arbitrary Elasticsearch settings can be specified through one or both of the following mechanisms.

[[es-cfg-ext]]
===== Embedding ES settings with `ext`

JanusGraph iterates over all properties prefixed with `index.[X].elasticsearch.ext.`, where `[X]` is an index name such as `search`.  It strips the prefix from each property key.  The remainder of the stripped key will be interpreted as an Elasticsearch configuration key.  The value associated with the key is not modified.  The stripped key and unmodified value are passed into the Elasticsearch client configuration.  This allows embedding arbitrary Elasticsearch settings in JanusGraph's properties.

===== JanusGraph `index.[X]` and `index.[X].elasticsearch` options

After processing `ext`, JanusGraph checks for the following common options.  JanusGraph's only uses default values for `index-name` and `health-request-timeout`.  If `ignore-cluster-name` or `cluster-name` is unset in JanusGraph's configuration, then Elasticsearch's internal defaults and any setting from `ext` apply, in that order.  See <<config-ref>> for descriptions of these options and their accepted values.

* `index.[X].elasticsearch.index-name`
* `index.[X].elasticsearch.cluster-name`
* `index.[X].elasticsearch.ignore-cluster-name`
* `index.[X].elasticsearch.health-request-timeout`

[[es-cfg-rest-opts]]
==== REST Client Options

The REST client accepts the `index.[X].bulk-refresh` option.  This option controls when changes are made visible to search. See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-refresh.html[?refresh documentation] for more information.  This this can also be set through the `ext` mechanism.

[[es-cfg-transport-opts]]
==== Transport Client Options

The Transport client accepts the `index.[X].client-sniff` option.  This can be set just as effectively through the `ext` mechanism.  However, it can also be controlled through this JanusGraph config option.  This option exists for continuity with the legacy config.

=== Secure Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch does not perform authentication or authorization.  A client that can connect to ES is trusted by ES.  When Elasticsearch runs on an unsecured or public network, particularly the Internet, it should be deployed with some type of external security.  This is generally done with a combination of firewalling and tunneling of Elasticsearch's ports.  Elasticsearch has two client-facing ports to consider:

* The HTTP REST API, usually on port 9200
* The native "transport" protocol, usually on port 9300

A client uses either one protocol/port or the other, but not both simultaneously.  Securing the HTTP protocol port is generally done with a combination of firewalling and a reverse proxy with SSL encryption and HTTP authentication. There are a couple of ways to approach security on the native "transport" protocol port:

Tunnel ES's native "transport" protocol::  This approach can be implemented with SSL/TLS tunneling (for instance via https://www.stunnel.org/index.html[stunnel]), a VPN, or SSH port forwarding.  SSL/TLS tunnels require non-trivial setup and monitoring: one or both ends of the tunnel need a certificate, and the stunnel processes need to be configured and running continuously in order for JanusGraph and Elasticsearch to communicate.  The setup for most secure VPNs is likewise non-trivial.  Some Elasticsearch service providers handle server-side tunnel management and provide a custom Elasticsearch `transport.type` to simplify the client setup.  JanusGraph is compatible with these custom transports.  See <<es-cfg-common-opts>> for information on how to override the `transport.type` and provide arbitrary `transport.*` config keys to JanusGraph's ES client.
Add a firewall rule that allows only trusted clients to connect on Elasticsearch's native protocol port:: This is typically done at the host firewall level.  This doesn't require any configuration changes in JanusGraph or Elasticsearch, nor does it require helper processes like stunnel.  Easy to configure, but very weak security by itself.

[[es-cfg-index-create]]
=== Index Creation Options

JanusGraph supports customization of the index settings it uses when creating its Elasticsearch index.  The customization mechanism is based on but distinct from the `ext` config prefix described in <<es-cfg-ext>>.  It allows setting arbitrary key-value pairs on the `settings` object in the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html[Elasticsearch `create index` request] issued by JanusGraph.  Here is a non-exhaustive sample of Elasticsearch index settings that can be customized using this mechanism:

* `index.number_of_replicas`
* `index.number_of_shards`
* `index.refresh_interval`

Settings customized through this mechanism are only applied when JanusGraph attempts to create its index in Elasticsearch.  If JanusGraph finds that its index already exists, then it does not attempt to recreate it, and these settings have no effect.

==== Embedding ES index creation settings with `create.ext`

JanusGraph iterates over all properties prefixed with `index.[X].elasticsearch.create.ext.`, where `[X]` is an index name such as `search`.  It strips the prefix from each property key.  The remainder of the stripped key will be interpreted as an Elasticsearch index creation setting.  The value associated with the key is not modified.  The stripped key and unmodified value are passed as part of the `settings` object in the Elasticsearch create index request that JanusGraph issues when bootstrapping on ES.  This allows embedding arbitrary index creation settings settings in JanusGraph's properties.  Here's an example configuration fragment that customizes three Elasticsearch index settings using the `create.ext` config mechanism:

[source, properties]
----
index.search.backend=elasticsearch
index.search.elasticsearch.create.ext.number_of_shards=15
index.search.elasticsearch.create.ext.number_of_replicas=3
index.search.elasticsearch.create.ext.shard.check_on_startup=true
----

The configuration fragment listed above takes advantage of Elasticsearch's assumption, implemented server-side, that unqualified `create index` setting keys have an `index.` prefix.  It's also possible to spell out the index prefix explicitly.  Here's a JanusGraph config file functionally equivalent to the one listed above, except that the `index.` prefix before the index creation settings is explicit:

[source, properties]
----
index.search.backend=elasticsearch
index.search.elasticsearch.create.ext.index.number_of_shards=15
index.search.elasticsearch.create.ext.index.number_of_replicas=3
index.search.elasticsearch.create.ext.index.shard.check_on_startup=false
----

[NOTE]
The `create.ext` config prefix described in this section is similar but not identical to the `ext` config prefix described in <<es-cfg-ext>>.  Whereas the `ext` prefix controls settings applied to the client connection, the `create.ext` prefix controls settings specific to index creation requests.

[TIP]
The `create.ext` mechanism for specifying index creation settings is compatible with JanusGraph's Elasticsearch configuration.  

=== Troubleshooting

==== Connection Issues to remote Elasticsearch cluster

Check that the Elasticsearch cluster nodes are reachable on the HTTP and native "transport" protocol ports from the JanusGraph nodes.  Check the node listen port by examining the Elasticsearch node configuration logs or using a general diagnostic utility like `netstat`.  Check the JanusGraph configuration.  Disable sniffing to restrict the Transport client to just the configured host list.  Check that the client and server have the same major version: 1.x and 2.x are not compatible.

==== Classpath or Field errors

When you see exception referring to lucene implementation details, make sure you don't have a conflicting version of Lucene on the classpath. Exception may look like this:

[source, text]
java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: LUCENE_5_5_2

=== Optimizing Elasticsearch

==== Write Optimization

For <<bulk-loading, bulk loading>> or other write-intense applications, consider increasing Elasticsearch's refresh interval. Refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/tune-for-indexing-speed.html[this discussion] on how to increase the refresh interval and its impact on write performance. Note, that a higher refresh interval means that it takes a longer time for graph mutations to be available in the index.

For additional suggestions on how to increase write performance in Elasticsearch with detailed instructions, please read http://blog.bugsense.com/post/35580279634/indexing-bigdata-with-elasticsearch[this blog post].
