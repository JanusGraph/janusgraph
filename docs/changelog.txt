* Added database level cache for lower latency query answering against warm data. Enable via `cache.db-cache`. Learn more about [[Database Cache]].
* Better caching implementation for relations (RelationCache) to provide faster de-serialization performance
* Addition of a new query optimizer that can significantly speed up a subset of traversals
* Support for reverse ordering in vertex centric queries by defining: makeLabel(..).sortKey(..).sortOrder(Order.DESC).make()

* Support for TEXT and STRING mapping of strings in both Lucene and ElasticSearch configurable as a parameter. Learn more about [[Full Text and String Search]]
* Refactored Text.REGEX/PREFIX to Text.CONTAINS_REGEX/CONTAINS_PREFIX to accurately reflect their semantics. Added Text.REGEX/PREFIX for full string matching. See [[Indexing Backend Overview]]
