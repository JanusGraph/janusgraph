Real-world graphs are not http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_graph[random]. Example real-world graphs include social graphs, word graphs, neural graphs, airline graphs, water flow graphs, etc. Interestingly enough, there is a simple statistical understanding of most natural graphs. In short, many vertices have few connections and very few vertices have many connections. A popular algorithm to generate a graph that has this connectivity pattern is known as the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment[preferential attachment] algorithm which can be simply described with the colloquial phrase: "the rich get richer." This section provides some simple code to artificially generate a natural looking graph in Titan using http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com[Gremlin].

Generating a Graph with Natural Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first thing to do is to connect to a Cassandra cluster with Titan. In the example below, a local connection is used where `storage.batch-loading` ensures more speedy performance.

[source,java]
conf = new BaseConfiguration()
conf.setProperty('storage.backend','cassandra')
conf.setProperty('storage.hostname','127.0.0.1')
conf.setProperty('storage.batch-loading','true');
g = TitanFactory.open(conf)

Next, the following script generates a graph with `size` number of edges.

[source,gremlin]
size = 100000; ids = [g.addVertex().id]; rand = new Random();
(1..size).each{
  v = g.addVertex();
  u = g.v(ids.get(rand.nextInt(ids.size())))
  g.addEdge(v,u,'linked');
  ids.add(u.id);
  ids.add(v.id);
  if(it % 1000 == 0) 
    g.commit()
}

Computing the In-Degree Distribution of the Graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[source,gremlin]
indegree = [:].withDefault{0}
ids.unique().each{ 
  count = g.v(it).inE.count();
  indegree[count] = indegree[count] + 1;
}
indegree.sort{a,b -> b.value <=> a.value}
