JanusGraph can be queried from all languages for which a TinkerPop
driver exists. Drivers allow sending of Gremlin traversals to a Gremlin
Server like the [JanusGraph Server](../basics/server.md). A list of TinkerPop
drivers is available on [TinkerPopâ€™s homepage](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/#language-drivers).

In addition to drivers, there exist 
[query languages for TinkerPop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/#language-variants-compilers)
that make it easier to use Gremlin in different programming languages
like Java, Python, or C\#. Some of these languages even construct
Gremlin traversals from completely different query languages like Cypher
or SPARQL. Since JanusGraph implements TinkerPop, all of these languages
can be used together with JanusGraph.
