Cloud Bigtable is Google's NoSQL Big Data database service. It's the same database that powers many core Google
services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and Gmail.

Bigtable is designed to handle massive workloads at consistent low latency and high throughput, so it's a great choice
for both operational and analytical applications, including IoT, user analytics, and financial data analysis.

=== Bigtable Setup

Bigtable implements the HBase interface for all data access operations, and
requires a few configuration options to connect.

==== Connecting to Bigtable

Configuring JanusGraph to connect to Bigtable is achieved by using the `hbase` backend, along with a custom connection
implementation, the project id of the Google Cloud Platform project containing the Bigtable instance, and the Cloud
Bigtable instance id you are connecting to.

Example:

[source,changelog]
....
storage.backend=hbase
storage.hbase.ext.hbase.client.connection.impl=com.google.cloud.bigtable.hbase1_x.BigtableConnection
storage.hbase.ext.google.bigtable.project.id=<Google Cloud Platform project id>
storage.hbase.ext.google.bigtable.instance.id=<Bigtable instance id>
....
