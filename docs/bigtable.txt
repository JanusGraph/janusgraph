Cloud Bigtable is Google's NoSQL Big Data database service. It's the same database that powers many core Google
services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and Gmail.

Bigtable is designed to handle massive workloads at consistent low latency and high throughput, so it's a great choice
for both operational and analytical applications, including IoT, user analytics, and financial data analysis.

=== Bigtable Setup

Bigtable implements the HBase interface for all data access operations, and requires some extra binary dependencies and
some specific configuration options to connect.

==== Dependencies

Bigtable connectivity relies on the `cloud-bigtable-client` library. This library is open-source and is
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-bigtable-client[hosted on GitHub]. JanusGraph uses the HBase 1.0 API,
so we require the lastest version of the
http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.cloud.bigtable/bigtable-hbase-1.0/0.9.5.1[bigtable-hbase-1.0 artifact.]

This library also uses the
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.netty/netty-tcnative-boringssl-static[netty-tcnative-boringssl-static] library
to make secure connections to Bigtable. Use the version recommended by the cloud-bigtable-client library.

These two dependencies must be on the classpath of the Java binary that connects to Bigtable. Maven dependencies could
be defined as:

[source,xml]
....
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.cloud.bigtable</groupId>
    <artifactId>bigtable-hbase-1.0</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.5.1</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
   <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
   <artifactId>netty-tcnative-boringssl-static</artifactId>
   <version>1.1.33.Fork19</version>
</dependency>
....

It is recommended to check the documentation on the cloud-bigtable-client github homepage for updated documentation on
dependencies and version numbers.

==== Connecting to Bigtable

Configuring JanusGraph to connect to Bigtable is achieved by using the `hbase` backend, along with a custom connection
implementation, the project id of the Google Cloud Platform project containing the Bigtable instance, and the Cloud 
Bigtable instance id you are connecting to.

Example:

[source,changelog]
....
storage.backend=hbase
storage.hbase.ext.hbase.client.connection.impl=com.google.cloud.bigtable.hbase1_0.BigtableConnection
storage.hbase.ext.google.bigtable.project.id=<Google Cloud Platform project id>
storage.hbase.ext.google.bigtable.instance.id=<Bigtable instance id>
....
