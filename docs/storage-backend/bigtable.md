Bigtable Setup
--------------

Bigtable implements the HBase interface for all data access operations,
and requires a few configuration options to connect.

### Connecting to Bigtable

Configuring JanusGraph to connect to Bigtable is achieved by using the
`hbase` backend, along with a custom connection implementation, the
project id of the Google Cloud Platform project containing the Bigtable
instance, and the Cloud Bigtable instance id you are connecting to.

Example:
```conf
storage.backend=hbase
storage.hbase.ext.hbase.client.connection.impl=com.google.cloud.bigtable.hbase1_x.BigtableConnection
storage.hbase.ext.google.bigtable.project.id=<Google Cloud Platform project id>
storage.hbase.ext.google.bigtable.instance.id=<Bigtable instance id>
```
