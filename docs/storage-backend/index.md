JanusGraph’s data storage layer is pluggable. Implementations of the
pluggable storage layer — that is, the software component tells
JanusGraph how to talk to its data store — are called storage backends.

This section describes configuration and administration of JanusGraph’s
standard storage backends.

This section only addresses configuration of the stock storage backends
that come with JanusGraph.
