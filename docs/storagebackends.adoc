= Storage Backends

JanusGraph's data storage layer is pluggable.  Implementations of the
pluggable storage layer -- that is, the software component tells JanusGraph
how to talk to its data store -- are called storage backends.

This section describes configuration and administration of JanusGraph's
standard storage backends.

This section only addresses configuration of the stock storage
backends that come with JanusGraph.
