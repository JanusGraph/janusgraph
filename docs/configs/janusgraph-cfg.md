### attributes.custom *
Custom attribute serialization and handling


| Name | Description | Datatype | Default Value | Mutability |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| attributes.custom.[X].attribute-class | Class of the custom attribute to be registered | String | (no default value) | GLOBAL_OFFLINE |

### cache
Configuration options that modify JanusGraph's caching behavior


| Name | Description | Datatype | Default Value | Mutability |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| cache.db-cache | Whether to enable JanusGraph's database-level cache, which is shared across all transactions. Enabling this option speeds up traversals by holding hot graph elements in memory, but also increases the likelihood of reading stale data.  Disabling it forces each transaction to independently fetch graph elements from storage before reading/writing them. | Boolean | false | MASKABLE |
| cache.db-cache-clean-wait | How long, in milliseconds, database-level cache will keep entries after flushing them.  This option is only useful on distributed storage backends that are capable of acknowledging writes without necessarily making them immediately visible. | Integer | 50 | GLOBAL_OFFLINE |
| cache.db-cache-size | Size of JanusGraph's database level cache.  Values between 0 and 1 are interpreted as a percentage of VM heap, while larger values are interpreted as an absolute size in bytes. | Double | 0.3 | MASKABLE |
| cache.db-cache-time | Default expiration time, in milliseconds, for entries in the database-level cache. Entries are evicted when they reach this age even if the cache has room to spare. Set to 0 to disable expiration (cache entries live forever or until memory pressure triggers eviction when set to 0). | Long | 10000 | GLOBAL_OFFLINE |
| cache.tx-cache-size | Maximum size of the transaction-level cache of recently-used vertices. | Integer | 20000 | MASKABLE |
| cache.tx-dirty-size | Initial size of the transaction-level cache of uncommitted dirty vertices. This is a performance hint for write-heavy, performance-sensitive transactional workloads. If set, it should roughly match the median vertices modified per transaction. | Integer | (no default value) | MASKABLE |

### cluster
Configuration options for multi-machine deployments


| Name | Description | Datatype | Default Value | Mutability |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| cluster.max-partitions | The number of virtual partition blocks created in the partitioned graph. This should be larger than the maximum expected number of nodes in the JanusGraph graph cluster. Must be greater than 1 and a power of 2. | Integer | 32 | FIXED |

### computer
GraphComputer related configuration


| Name | Description | Datatype | Default Value | Mutability |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |

### graph
General configuration options


| Name | Description | Datatype | Default Value | Mutability |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| graph.allow-stale-config | Whether to allow the local and storage-backend-hosted copies of the configuration to contain conflicting values for options with any of the following types: FIXED, GLOBAL_OFFLINE, GLOBAL.  These types are managed globally through the storage backend and cannot be overridden by changing the local configuration.  This type of conflict usually indicates misconfiguration.  When this option is true, JanusGraph will log these option conflicts, but continue normal operation using the storage-backend-hosted value for each conflicted option.  When this option is false, JanusGraph will log these option conflicts, but then it will throw an exception, refusing to start. | Boolean | true | MASKABLE |
| graph.allow-upgrade | Setting this to true will allow certain fixed values to be updated such as storage-version. This should only be used for upgrading. | Boolean | false | MASKABLE |
| graph.assign-timestamp | Whether to use JanusGraph generated client-side timestamp in mutations if the backend supports it. When enabled, JanusGraph assigns one timestamp to all insertions and another slightly earlier timestamp to all deletions in the same batch. When this is disabled, mutation behavior depends on the backend. Some might use server-side timestamp (e.g. HBase) while others might use client-side timestamp generated by driver (CQL). | Boolean | true | LOCAL |
| graph.graphname | This config option is an optional configuration setting that you may supply when opening a graph. The String value you provide will be the name of your graph. If you use the ConfigurationManagement APIs, then you will be able to access your graph by this String representation using the ConfiguredGraphFactory APIs. | String | (no default value) | LOCAL |
| graph.replace-instance-if-exists | If a JanusGraph instance with the same instance identifier already exists, the usage of this configuration option results in the opening of this graph anwyay. | Boolean | false | LOCAL |
| graph.set-vertex-id | Whether user provided vertex ids should be enabled and JanusGraph's automatic id allocation be disabled. Useful when operating JanusGraph in concert with another storage system that assigns long ids but disables some of JanusGraph's advanced features which can lead to inconsistent data. EXPERT FEATURE - USE WITH GREAT CARE. | Boolean | false | FIXED |
| graph.storage-version | The version of JanusGraph storage schema with which this database was created. Automatically set on first start of graph. Should only ever be changed if upgrading to a new major release version of JanusGraph that contains schema changes | String | (no default value) | FIXED |
| graph.timestamps | The timestamp resolution to use when writing to storage and indices. Sets the time granularity for the entire graph cluster. To avoid potential inaccuracies, the configured time resolution should match those of the backend systems. Some JanusGraph storage backends declare a preferred timestamp resolution that reflects design constraints in the underlying service. When the backend provides a preferred default, and when this setting is not explicitly declared in the config file, the backend default is used and the general default associated with this setting is ignored.  An explicit declaration of this setting overrides both the general and backend-specific defaults. | TimestampProviders | MICRO | FIXED |
| graph.unique-instance-id | Unique identifier for this JanusGraph instance.  This must be unique among all instances concurrently accessing the same stores or indexes.  It's automatically generated by concatenating the hostname, process id, and a static (process-wide) counter. Leaving it unset is recommended. | String | (no default value) | LOCAL |
| graph.unique-instance-id-suffix | When this is set and unique-instance-id is not, this JanusGraph instance's unique identifier is generated by concatenating the hex encoded hostname to the provided number. | Short | (no default value) | LOCAL |
| graph.use-hostname-for-unique-instance-id | When this is set, this JanusGraph's unique instance identifier is set to the hostname. If unique-instance-id-suffix is also set, then the identifier is set to <hostname><suffix>. | Boolean | false | LOCAL |

### ids
General configuration options for graph element IDs


| Name | Description | Datatype | Default Value | Mutability |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ids.block-size | Globally reserve graph element IDs in chunks of this size.  Setting this too low will make commits frequently block on slow reservation requests.  Setting it too high will result in IDs wasted when a graph instance shuts down with reserved but mostly-unused blocks. | Integer | 10000 | GLOBAL_OFFLINE |
| ids.flush | When true, vertices and edges are assigned IDs immediately upon creation.  When false, IDs are assigned only when the transaction commits. | Boolean | true | MASKABLE |
| ids.num-partitions | Number of partition block to allocate for placement of vertices | Integer | 10 | MASKABLE |
| ids.placement | Name of the vertex placement strategy or full class name | String | simple | MASKABLE |
| ids.renew-percentage | When the most-recently-reserved ID block has only this percentage of its total IDs remaining (expressed as a value between 0 and 1), JanusGraph asynchronously begins reserving another block. This helps avoid transaction commits waiting on ID reservation even if the block size is relatively small. | Double | 0.3 | MASKABLE |
| ids.renew-timeout | The number of milliseconds that the JanusGraph id pool manager will wait before giving up on allocating a new block of ids | Duration | 120000 ms | MASKABLE |
| ids.store-name | The name of the ID KCVStore. IDS_STORE_NAME is meant to be used only for backward compatibility with Titan, and should not be used explicitly in normal operations or in new graphs. | String | janusgraph_ids | GLOBAL_OFFLINE |

### ids.authority
Configuration options for graph element ID reservation/allocation


| Name | Description | Datatype | Default Value | Mutability |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |

| ids.authority.conflict-avoidance-tag | Conflict avoidance tag to be used by this JanusGraph instance when allocating IDs | Integer | 0 | LOCAL |
| ids.authority.conflict-avoidance-tag-bits | Configures the number of bits of JanusGraph-assigned element IDs that are reserved for the conflict avoidance tag | Integer | 4 | FIXED |
| ids.authority.randomized-conflict-avoidance-retries | Number of times the system attempts ID block reservations with random conflict avoidance tags before giving up and throwing an exception | Integer | 5 | MASKABLE |
| ids.authority.wait-time | The number of milliseconds the system waits for an ID block reservation to be acknowledged by the storage backend | Duration | 300 ms | GLOBAL_OFFLINE |

### query
Configuration options for query processing


| Name | Description | Datatype | Default Value | Mutability |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| query.batch | Whether traversal queries should be batched when executed against the storage backend. This can lead to significant performance improvement if there is a non-trivial latency to the backend. | Boolean | false | MASKABLE |
| query.batch-property-prefetch | Whether to do a batched pre-fetch of all properties on adjacent vertices against the storage backend prior to evaluating a has condition against those vertices. Because these vertex properties will be loaded into the transaction-level cache of recently-used vertices when the condition is evaluated this can lead to significant performance improvement if there are many edges to adjacent vertices and there is a non-trivial latency to the backend. | Boolean | false | MASKABLE |
| query.fast-property | Whether to pre-fetch all properties on first singular vertex property access. This can eliminate backend calls on subsequent property access for the same vertex at the expense of retrieving all properties at once. This can be expensive for vertices with many properties | Boolean | true | MASKABLE |

Doing solimits the functionality of JanusGraph's graph queries but ensures that slow graph queries are avoided on large graphs. Recommended for production use of JanusGraph. | Boolean | false | MASKABLE |
| query.hard-max-limit | If smart-limit is disabled and no limit is given in the query, query optimizer adds a limit in light of possibly large result sets. It works in the same way as smart-limit except that hard-max-limit is usually a large number. Default value is Integer.MAX_VALUE which effectively disables this behavior. This option does not take effect when smart-limit is enabled. | Integer | 2147483647 | MASKABLE |
| query.ignore-unknown-index-key | Whether to ignore undefined types encountered in user-provided index queries | Boolean | false | MASKABLE |
| query.index-select-strategy | Name of the index selection strategy or full class name. Following shorthands can be used: <br>- `brute-force` (Try all combinations of index candidates and pick up optimal one)<br>- `approximate` (Use greedy algorithm to pick up approximately optimal index candidate)<br>- `threshold-based` (Use index-select-threshold to pick up either `approximate` or `threshold-based` strategy on runtime) | String | threshold-based | MASKABLE |
| query.index-select-threshold | Threshold of deciding whether to use brute force enumeration algorithm or fast approximation algorithm for selecting suitable indexes. Selecting optimal indexes for a query is a NP-complete set cover problem. When number of suitable index candidates is no larger than threshold, JanusGraph uses brute force search with exponential time complexity to ensure the best combination of indexes is selected. Only effective when `threshold-based` index select strategy is chosen. | Integer | 10 | MASKABLE |
| query.limit-batch-size | Configure a maximum batch size for queries against the storage backend. This can be used to ensure responsiveness if batches tend to grow very large. The used batch size is equivalent to the barrier size of a preceding barrier() step. If a step has no preceding barrier(), the default barrier of TinkerPop will be inserted. This option only takes effect if query.batch is enabled. | Boolean | false | MASKABLE |
| query.optimizer-backend-access | Whether the optimizer should be allowed to fire backend queries during the optimization phase. Allowing these will give the optimizer a chance to find more efficient execution plan but also increase the optimization overhead. | Boolean | true | MASKABLE |
| query.smart-limit | Whether the query optimizer should try to guess a smart limit for the query to ensure responsiveness in light of possibly large result sets. Those will be loaded incrementally if this option is enabled. | Boolean | false | MASKABLE |

### storage.cql.internal
Advanced configuration of internal DataStax driver. Notice, all available configurations will be composed in the order. Non specified configurations will be skipped.

The configurations are composed in the next order (sorted by priority in descending order): `file-configuration`, `resource-configuration`, `string-configuration`, `url-configuration`, `base-programmatic-configuration` (which is controlled by `base-programmatic-configuration-enabled` property). Configurations with higher priority always overwrite configurations with lower priority. I.e. if the same configuration parameter is used in both `file-configuration` and `string-configuration` the configuration parameter from `file-configuration` will be used and configuration parameter from `string-configuration` will be ignored.

JanusGraph instances that have the same value for this variable will attempt to discover lock contention among themselves in memory before proceeding with the general-case distributed locking code.  JanusGraph generates an appropriate default value for this option at startup.  Overriding the default is generally only useful in testing. | String | (no default value) | LOCAL |
| storage.lock.retries | Number of times the system attempts to acquire a lock before giving up and throwing an exception | Integer | 3 | MASKABLE |
| storage.lock.wait-time | Number of milliseconds the system waits for a lock application to be acknowledged by the storage backend. Also, the time waited at the end of all lock applications before verifying that the applications were successful. This value should be a small multiple of the average consistent write time.

May be ignored if custom executor service is used (depending on the implementation of the executor service).If not set the core pool size will be equal to number of processors multiplied by 2. | Integer | (no default value) | LOCAL |
| storage.parallel-backend-executor-service.keep-alive-time | Keep alive time in milliseconds for executor service. When the number of threads is greater than the `core-pool-size`, this is the maximum time that excess idle threads will wait for new tasks before terminating. Ignored for `fixed` executor service and may be ignored if custom executor service is used (depending on the implementation of the executor service). | Long | 60000 | LOCAL |
| storage.parallel-backend-executor-service.max-pool-size | Maximum pool size for executor service. Ignored for `fixed` and `cached` executor services. May be ignored if custom executor service is used (depending on the implementation of the executor service). | Integer | 2147483647 | LOCAL |
| storage.parallel-backend-executor-service.max-shutdown-wait-time | Max shutdown wait time in milliseconds for executor service threads to be finished during shutdown. After this time threads will be interrupted (signalled with interrupt) without any additional wait time. | Long | 60000 | LOCAL |

### tx
Configuration options for transaction handling


| Name | Description | Datatype | Default Value | Mutability |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| tx.log-tx | Whether transaction mutations should be logged to JanusGraph's write-ahead transaction log which can be used for recovery of partially failed transactions | Boolean | false | GLOBAL |
| tx.max-commit-time | Maximum time (in ms) that a transaction might take to commit against all backends. This is used by the distributed write-ahead log processing to determine when a transaction can be considered failed (i.e. after this time has elapsed).Must be longer than the maximum allowed write time. | Duration | 10000 ms | GLOBAL |

### tx.recovery
Configuration options for transaction recovery processes


| Name | Description | Datatype | Default Value | Mutability |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| tx.recovery.verbose | Whether the transaction recovery system should print recovered transactions and other activity to standard output | Boolean | false | MASKABLE |
