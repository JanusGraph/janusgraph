http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com[Gremlin] is a graph traversal language developed by http://tinkerpop.com[TinkerPop]. Titan-Hadoop Gremlin steps are implemented in http://hadoop.apache.org/mapreduce/[MapReduce]. For sake of clarity, the Gremlin that compiles down to http://pipes.tinkerpop.com[Pipes] and is used for real-time traversals against a graph database is denoted Gremlin/Pipes. The Gremlin that is distributed with Titan-Hadoop and compiles down to MapReduce is denoted Gremlin/Faunus.

There are major conceptual differences between Gremlin/Pipes and Gremlin/Faunus. These differences are itemized below.

* Gremlin/Faunus is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search[breadth-first]. Gremlin/Pipes is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search[depth-first].
* Gremlin/Faunus processes rows of an adjacency matrix (vertex-centric). Gremlin/Pipes processes elements in a linked-list (element-centric).
* Gremlin/Faunus is inherently parallel with each vertex being operated on simultaneously. Gremlin/Pipes is inherently serial with one element at a time being pushed through the pipeline.

The table below presents the steps provided with Gremlin/Faunus.

Note on Path-Based Traversals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a computation requires the history of a traversal, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics[combinatoric] explosions can occur which are expensive in terms of both space (the size of the output) and time (computing the output). The following steps are steps that turn *on* path computations. By default, path computations are turned *off* unless `enablePath()` is explicitly called within the expression. 

* `path`
* `simplePath`
* `back`
* `linkOut`
* `linkIn`

When paths are turned on, Titan-Hadoop provides a `WARN` message.

12/09/17 09:00:25 WARN mapreduce.HadoopCompiler: Path calculations are enabled for this Titan-Hadoop job (space and time expensive)
...

In short, be wary of long (or non-filtering) traversals that make use of path information as this can greatly hinder performance and lead to memory issues (even disk memory issues!).
