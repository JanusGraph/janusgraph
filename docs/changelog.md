# Changelog

## Version Compatibility

The JanusGraph project is growing along with the rest of the graph and
big data ecosystem and utilized storage and indexing backends. Below are
version compatibilities between the various versions of components. For
dependent backend systems, different minor versions are typically
supported as well. It is strongly encouraged to verify version
compatibility prior to deploying JanusGraph.

Although JanusGraph may be compatible with older and no longer supported
versions of its dependencies, users are warned that there are possible
risks and security exposures with running software that is no longer
supported or updated. Please check with the software providers to
understand their supported versions. Users are strongly encouraged to
use the latest versions of the software.

### Version Compatibility Matrix

#### Currently supported

All currently supported versions of JanusGraph are listed below. 

!!! info
    You are currently viewing the documentation page of JanusGraph version {{ latest_version }}. To ensure that the information below is up to date, please double check that this is not an archived version of the documentation.

| JanusGraph | Storage Version | Cassandra | HBase | Bigtable | ScyllaDB | Elasticsearch | Solr | TinkerPop | Spark | Scala |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1.0.z | 2 | 3.11.z, 4.0.z | 2.5.z | 1.3.0, 1.4.0, 1.5.z, 1.6.z, 1.7.z, 1.8.z, 1.9.z, 1.10.z, 1.11.z, 1.14.z | 5.y | 6.y, 7.y, 8.y | 8.y | 3.7.z | 3.2.z | 2.12.z |

!!! info
    Even so ScyllaDB is marked as `N/A` prior version 1.0.0 it was actually supported using `cql` storage option. 
    The only difference is that from version 1.0.0 JanusGraph officially supports ScyllaDB using `scylla` and `cql` 
    storage options and have extended test coverage for ScyllaDB.

**Tested Compatibility:**

* Apache Cassandra 3.11.10, 4.0.6
* Apache HBase 2.5.0
* Oracle BerkeleyJE 7.5.11
* ScyllaDB 5.1.4
* Elasticsearch 6.0.1, 6.6.0, 7.17.8, 8.10.4

!!! note
    Google Bigtable was removed from this list because there is no automatic testing in place specifically for that
    backend.
    Since the adapter for Bigtable is however just using the HBase adapter, it is also covered by the tests for HBase.

    We invite anyone who is interested in the Bigtable storage adapter to help with this by contributing so that the
    tests for HBase are also automatically executed for Bigtable.

#### Upgrade Instructions

##### Upgrade TinkerPop from 3.5.x to 3.7.0 (breaking)

Some packages under `gremlin-driver` are moved to `gremlin-util` module. This means you need to change
some classnames of serializers, e.g. from `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.ser.*` to `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.util.ser.*`.
See [this](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/upgrade/#_creation_of_new_gremlin_util_module) for more detail.

GraphSON serializers are renamed, e.g. from `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.ser.GraphSONMessageSerializerV3d0` to `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.util.ser.GraphSONMessageSerializerV3`.
See [this](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/upgrade/#_serializer_renaming) for more detail.

##### String vertex ID support (breaking change)

Users now can use custom string vertex ids. See [Custom Vertex ID](advanced-topics/custom-vertex-id.md) documentation. Prior
to this change, JanusGraph automatically casts IDs of string type to long type if possible. Now this
auto conversion is disabled. If you have a vertex with ID 1234, `g.V("1234")` would no longer help you
find the vertex - you would have to do `g.V(1234)` now.

This feature brings about a breaking change to GraphBinary serializer. As such, users who use [GraphBinary](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.7.0/dev/io/#graphbinary)
serialization format must update JanusGraph server and all clients at once, since the change is backward
incompatible.

!!! warning
    Even if you don't enable string vertex id feature, you are still impacted as long as you
    use GraphBinary serializer.

##### Upgrade of log4j to version 2

This change requires a new log4j configuration. You can find an example configuration in `conf/log4j2-server.xml`. As a result of the changed configuration format,
we clean up all configurations. This could lead to unexpected new log lines. Please open an issue, if you see any unwanted log line.

!!! note
    Log4j is only used for standalone server deployments and JanusGraph testing.

##### Removal of cassandra-all dependency

JanusGraph had a dependency on cassandra-all only for some Hadoop-related classes. We moved these few classes into
a new module cassandra-hadoop-util to reduce the dependencies of JanusGraph. If you are running embedded JanusGraph with
Cassandra, you have to exclude the `cassandra-hadoop-util` from `janusgraph-cql`.

##### Drop support for HBase 1

We are dropping support for HBase 1.

##### Drop support for Solr 7

We are dropping support for Solr 7.

##### Drop support for Gryo MessageSerializer

Support for Gryo MessageSerializer [has been dropped in TinkerPop 3.6.0](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.6.1/upgrade/#_removed_gryo_messageserializers)
and we therefore also no longer support it in JanusGraph.
GraphBinary is now used as the default MessageSerializer.

##### Remove support for old serialization format of JanusGraph predicates

We are dropping support for old serialization format of JanusGraph predicates. The old predicates serialization format is only used by client older than 0.6.
The change only affects GraphSON.

##### Allow removal of configuration keys

Users can now remove configuration keys in the ConfiguredGraphFactory's configuration:

```groovy
ConfiguredGraphFactory.removeConfiguration("<graph_name>", Collections.singleton("<config_key>"))
```

Or the global configuration:
```groovy
mgmt = graph.openManagement()
mgmt.remove("<config_key>")
mgmt.commit()
```

Note that the above commands should be used with care. They cannot be used to drop an external index backend if it has mixed indexes for instance.

##### New index management

The index management has received an overhaul which enables proper index removal.
The schema action `REMOVE_INDEX` is no longer available and has been replaced by `DISCARD_INDEX`. See
[Index Lifecycle](schema/index-management/index-lifecycle.md) documentation for more details.

##### `totals` for direct index queries now applies provided offset and limit

Direct index queries which search count for totals (`vertexTotals`, `edgeTotals`, `propertyTotals` and direct execution of 
`IndexProvider.totals`) now apply provided `limit` and `offset`. Previously provided `limit` and `offset` were ignored.    
For example, previously the following query would return `500` if there were `500` indexed elements: 

```groovy
gremlin> graph.indexQuery("textIndex", "v.\"text\":fooBar").limit(10).vertexTotals()
```

Now the above query will return `10` elements because we limited the result to `10` elements only.
Same applies to `offset`. Previously the following query would return `500` if there were `500` indexed elements:

```groovy
gremlin> graph.indexQuery("textIndex", "v.\"text\":fooBar").offset(10).vertexTotals()
```

Now the above query will return `490` as a result because we skip count of the first `10` elements.    
`offset` provided with `limit` will apply `offset` first and `limit` last.  
For example, the above query will return `10` elements now if there were `500` indexed elements:

```groovy
gremlin> graph.indexQuery("textIndex", "v.\"text\":fooBar").limit(10).offset(10).vertexTotals()
```

The new logic is applied similarly to Direct Index Queries `vertexTotals()`, `edgeTotals()`, `propertyTotals()` as well 
as internal JanusGraph method `IndexProvider.totals`.

##### Add support for Java 11

JanusGraph now officially supports Java 11 in addition to Java 8. We encourage everyone to update to Java 11.

!!! note
    The pre-packaged distribution now requires Java 11.

##### Batch Processing enabled by default. Configuration changes.

`query.batch` is now a configuration namespace. Thus, previous `query.batch` configuration is replaced by `query.batch.enabled`.
`query.limit-batch-size` configuration option is changed to `query.batch.limited`.

`query.batch-property-prefetch` was replaced by a better configurable option. In case previous behaviour is desired then
use `query.batch.has-step-mode = none` as replacement for `query.batch-property-prefetch = false` or use
`query.batch.has-step-mode = all_properties` as replacement for `query.batch-property-prefetch = true`.

`query.fast-property` has no influence on `values`, `properties`, `valueMap`, `propertyMap`, `elementMap` anymore when 
`query.batch.enabled` is `true`. By default, those steps are configured to fetch only required properties 
(with separate query per property), but the behaviour can be changed with the configuration `query.batch.properties-mode`. 
In case previous behavior is desired, use `query.batch.properties-mode = required_properties_only` for `query.fast-property = false` 
or use `query.batch.properties-mode = all_properties` for `query.fast-property = true`. 

`label` step now uses pre-fetching strategy by default. Use `query.batch.label-step-mode = none` to disable pre-fetching 
optimization for `label` step.

[Batch processing](https://docs.janusgraph.org/operations/batch-processing/) allows JanusGraph to fetch a batch of
vertices from the storage backend together instead of requesting each vertex individually which leads to a high number
of backend queries.
This was however disabled by default in JanusGraph because these batches could become much larger than what was needed
for the traversal and therefore have a negative performance impact for some traversals.
That is why an improved batch processing mode was added in JanusGraph 0.6.0 that limits the size of these batches
retrieved from the storage backend, called
[_Limited Batch Processing_](https://docs.janusgraph.org/operations/batch-processing/#limited-batch-processing).
This mode therefore solves the problem of having potentially unlimited batch sizes.
That is why we now enable this mode by default as most users should benefit from this limited batch processing.

If you want to continue using JanusGraph without batch processing, then you have to manually disable it by setting
`query.batch.enabled` to `false`.

The size of the batches can be limited by using `barrier()` steps if limited batch processing is used (`query.batch.limited` set to `true`). 
A special strategy exists which already inserts `barrier()` steps by default for some steps, the `LazyBarrierStrategy`. 
A new configuration option `query.batch.limited-size` exists to configure default barrier step size for batch processing 
for batch cases when `LazyBarrierStrategy` not applied `.barrier` step and no user-provided barrier step exists for 
batchable query part. Notice, that `query.batch.limited-size` is only used when `query.batch.limited` is `true` (default in this version).  

##### Batch registration for nested batch compatible steps is changed for `repeat` step

Previously any batch compatible steps like `out`, `in`, `values`, etc. would receive vertices for batch registration 
from all `repeat` parent steps, but only for their starts in case of multi-nested repeat steps 
(skipping their subsequent iterations registration). 
With JanusGraph 1.0.0 batches registration for the subsequent iterations of multi-nested repeat steps are used as well.  

```groovy
g.V(startVertexId).emit().
    repeat(__.repeat(__.in("connects")).emit()).
    until(__.loops().is(P.gt(2)))
```
In the example above multi-nested `repeat` case would not register vertices returned from the inner `emit()` step
for the next outer iteration which would result in sequential calls of `in("connects")` for next outer iteration. The behaviour is
now changed to register these vertices for the next child `repeat` step start.

The behaviour can be controlled by `query.batch.repeat-step-mode` configuration option.  
In case the old behaviour is preferable then `query.batch.repeat-step-mode` should be set to `starts_only_of_all_repeat_parents`.

However, in cases when transaction cache is small and repeat step traverses more than one level 
deep, it could result for some vertices to be re-fetched again which would mean a waste of operation when it isn't necessary. 
In such situations `closest_repeat_parent` mode might be more preferable than `all_repeat_parents`.  
With `closest_repeat_parent` mode vertices for batch registration will be received from the start of the closest 
`repeat` step as well as the end of the closest `repeat` step (for the next iteration). Any other parent `repeat` steps 
will be ignored.

##### ConfiguredGraphFactory now creates separate indices per graph in Elasticsearch

If the ConfiguredGraphFactory is used together with Elasticsearch as the index backend, then the same Elasticsearch
index is used for all graphs (if the same index names were used across different graphs).
Now it is possible to let JanusGraph create the index names dynamically by using the `graph.graphname` if no
`index.[X].index-name` is provided in the template configuration. This is exactly like it was already the case for the
CQL keyspace name for example.

Users who don't want to use this feature can simply continue providing the index name via `index.[X].index-name` in the
template configuration.

##### Mixed index aggregation optimization

A new optimization has been added to compute aggregations (min, max, sum and avg) using mixed index engine (if the aggregation function follows an indexed query).
If the index backend is Elasticsearch, a `double` value is used to hold the result. As a result, aggregations on long numbers greater than 2^53 are approximate.
In this case, if the accurate result is essential, the optimization can be disabled by removing the strategy `JanusGraphMixedIndexAggStrategy`: `g.traversal().withoutStrategies(JanusGraphMixedIndexAggStrategy.class)`.

##### Add support for ElasticSearch 8

JanusGraph now supports ElasticSearch 8.   
Notice, `Mapping.PREFIX_TREE` mapping is no longer available for Geoshape mappings using new ElasticSearch 8 indices.  
`Mapping.PREFIX_TREE` is still supported in ElasticSearch 6, ElasticSearch 7, Solr, Lucene.     
For ElasticSearch the new Geoshape mapping was added `Mapping.BKD`.  
It's recommended to use `Mapping.BKD` mapping due to better performance characteristics over `Mapping.PREFIX_TREE`.   
The downside of `Mapping.BKD` is that it doesn't support Circle shapes. Thus, JanusGraph provides BKD Circle processors
to convert Circle into other shapes for indexing but use Circle at the storage level. More information about
Circle processors available under configuration namespace `index.[X].bkd-circle-processor`.    
ElasticSearch 8 doesn't allow creating new indexes with `Mapping.PREFIX_TREE` mapping, but the existing indices
using `Mapping.PREFIX_TREE` will work in ElasticSearch 8 after migration. See
[ElasticSearch 8 migration guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/migrating-8.0.html#geo-shape-strategy).

##### Add support for ScyllaDB driver

A new module `janusgraph-scylla` provides ability to run JanusGraph with ScyllaDB Driver which is an optimized
fork version of DataStax Java Driver for ScyllaDB storage backend.   
For ScyllaDB storage backend you can use either `janusgraph-scylla` or `janusgraph-cql` (which is a general CQL storage
driver implementation). That said, it's recommended to use `janusgraph-scylla` for ScyllaDB due to the provided internal
optimizations (more about ScyllaDB driver optimizations can be found [here](https://docs.scylladb.com/stable/using-scylla/drivers/cql-drivers/scylla-java-driver.html)).

Notice that `janusgraph-cql` and `janusgraph-scylla` are mutually exclusive. Use only one module at a time and never
provide both dependencies in the same classpath. See [ScyllaDB Storage Backend documentation](storage-backend/scylladb.md) for more
information about how to make `scylla` `storage.backend` options available.

##### CQL ExecutorService purpose change

Previously CQL ExecutorService was used to control parallelism of both CQL IO operations and results deserialization. 
Starting from JanusGraph 1.0.0 CQL ExecutorService is now used for CQL results deserialization only. All CQL IO operations 
are now using internal async approach.  
The default pool size is now set to have a value of `number of cores multiplied by 2`. This ExecutorService is now 
mandatory and cannot be disabled. The default ExecutorService core pool size is not recommended to be changed as 
the default value is considered to be optimal unless users want to artificially limit parallelism of CQL results deserialization 
jobs.

##### A new multi-query method added into `KeyColumnValueStore` (affects storage adapters implementations only)

A new method `Map<SliceQuery, Map<StaticBuffer, EntryList>> getMultiSlices(MultiKeysQueryGroups<StaticBuffer, SliceQuery> multiKeysQueryGroups, StoreTransaction txh)` 
is added into `KeyColumnValueStore` which is now preferred for multi-queries (batch queries) with multiple slice queries.  
In case a multi-query executes more than one Slice query per multi-query execution then those Slice queries will be 
grouped per same key sets and the new `getMultiSlices` query will be executed with groups of different `SliceQuery` for the same sets of keys.  

Notice, if the storage doesn't have multiQuery feature enabled - the method won't be used. Hence, it's not necessary to implement it.  

In case storage backend has multiQuery feature enabled, then it is highly recommended to overwrite the default (non-optimized) implementation 
and optimize this method execution to execute all the slice queries for all the requested keys in the shortest time possible 
(for example, by using asynchronous programming, slice queries grouping, multi-threaded execution, or any other technique which 
is efficient for the respective storage adapter).  

##### Added possibility to group multiple slice queries together via CQL storage backend

Starting from JanusGraph 1.0.0 CQL storage implementation now groups queries which fetch properties with `Cardinality.SINGLE` together
into the same CQL query. The behaviour can be disabled by setting configuration `storage.cql.grouping.slice-allowed = false`. 

CQL storage implementation has also ability to group queries of different partition keys together if they belong to the same 
token range or same replicas set (grouping strategy is available via `storage.cql.grouping.keys-class` configuration option). 
This behaviour is disabled by default, but can be enabled via `storage.cql.grouping.keys-allowed = true`. 
Please note that enabling the key grouping feature can increase the return size of related queries. 
This is due to each row in a CQL query, which encompasses grouped keys, needing to return its specific key. 
Moreover, it could potentially lead to less balanced load on the storage cluster. However, it reduces the amount of CQL 
queries sent which may positively influence throughput in some cases as well as pricing point of some Serverless deployments. 
We recommend to benchmark each use-case before enabling keys grouping (`storage.cql.grouping.keys-allowed`).

Notice, keys grouping (`storage.cql.grouping.keys-allowed`) can be used only with storage backends which support `PER PARTITION LIMIT`. 
As such, this feature can't be used with Amazon Keyspaces because it doesn't support `PER PARTITION LIMIT`.

Different storage backends may also have restriction set on maximum keys which can be provided via `IN` operator (which is needed for grouping). 
It is required to ensure that `storage.cql.grouping.keys-limit` or `storage.cql.grouping.slice-limit` is less than or equal to the 
restriction provided via the storage backend.
On ScyllaDB it's possible to configure this restriction using [max-partition-key-restrictions-per-query](https://enterprise.docs.scylladb.com/branch-2022.2/faq.html#how-can-i-change-the-maximum-number-of-in-restrictions) 
configuration option (default to `100`).
On AstraDB side it is needed to be asked on AstraDB side to be changed via `partition_keys_in_select_failure_threshold` and `in_select_cartesian_product_failure_threshold` threshold 
configurations (https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/plan/planning.html#_cassandra_yaml) which are set to `20` and `25` by default.

See additional properties to control grouping configurations under the namespace `storage.cql.grouping`.

#### Upgrade Instructions

##### Default logging library changed to Reload4j

The default logging library used in the pre-packaged distribution has been changed in version 0.6.3 by accident from
Log4j to Logback.
While this change meant that some security issues of Log4j were avoided, it was also a breaking change that was not
intended.
This resulted in only warnings being logged by default and also that a Log4j config file was ignored.
To fix this breaking change, we change the default logging library in this release to [Reload4j](https://reload4j.qos.ch/)
which is completely compatible with Log4j, but fixes the security issues of Log4j.
This means that Log4j config files will continue to work with this version.

Note that this only applies to JanusGraph 0.6.
JanusGraph 1.0.0 uses Log4j2 by default.

!!! note
    Google Bigtable was removed from this list because there is no automatic testing in place specifically for that
    backend.
    Since the adapter for Bigtable is however just using the HBase adapter, it is also covered by the tests for HBase.
    
    We invite anyone who is interested in the Bigtable storage adapter to help with this by contributing so that the
    tests for HBase are also automatically executed for Bigtable.

#### Upgrade Instructions

##### GraphManager changed to JanusGraphManager

A `GraphManager` is used to instantiate graph instances. JanusGraph Server has used the
`DefaultGraphManager` from TinkerPop for this by default if no other `GraphManager` was specified
in the JanusGraph Server YAML config file.
The behavior of this `DefaultGraphManager` was changed in TinkerPop 3.5.0 which is included in
JanusGraph 0.6.0 in how it parses config values, making it impossible to provide comma separated
values, e.g., to specify multiple hostnames for the storage backend. The `JanusGraphManager` does
not have this limitation which is why it is now configured as the `GraphManager` in the
JanusGraph Server config files:

```yaml
[...]
channelizer: org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.channel.WebSocketChannelizer
graphManager: org.janusgraph.graphdb.management.JanusGraphManager
graphs: {
  graph: conf/janusgraph-berkeleyje-es.properties
}
[...]
```

If you however want to continue using the `DefaultGraphManager`, then you can simply remove the
setting again or change it to the TinkerPop `GraphManager` that has been the default before:
`org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.util.DefaultGraphManager`.

#### Upgrade Instructions

##### Experimental support for Amazon Keyspaces

[Amazon Keyspaces](https://aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/) is a serverless managed Apache Cassandra-compatible
database service provided by Amazon. See [Deploying on Amazon Keyspaces](https://docs.janusgraph.org/storage-backend/cassandra/#deploying-on-amazon-keyspaces-experimental)
for more details.

##### Breaking change for Configuration objects

Prior to JanusGraph 0.6.0, `Configuration` objects were from the Apache `commons-configuration` library.
To comply with the [TinkerPop change](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.5.0/upgrade/#_versions_and_dependencies),
JanusGraph now uses the `commons-configuration2` library. A typical usage of configuration object is to
create configuration using `ConfigurationGraphFactory`. Now you would need to use the new configuration2 library.
Please refer to the
[commons-configuration 2.0 migration guide](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/userguide/upgradeto2_0.html)
for details. Note that this very likely does not affect gremlin console usage, since the new library
is auto-imported, and the basic APIs remain the same. For java code usage, you need to import
configuration2 library rather than the old configuration library.

##### Breaking change for gremlin server configs

`scriptEvaluationTimeout` is renamed to `evaluationTimeout`. You can refer to `conf/gremlin-server/gremlin-server.yaml`
for example.

##### Breaking change for gremlin EventStrategy usage

If you are using [EventStrategy](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/javadocs/current/full/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/process/traversal/strategy/decoration/EventStrategy.html),
please note that now you need to register it every time you start a new transaction.
An example is available at [ThreadLocalTxLeakTest::eventListenersCanBeReusedAcrossTx](https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/blob/master/janusgraph-test/src/test/java/org/janusgraph/core/ThreadLocalTxLeakTest.java)
See more background of this breaking change in this
[pull request](https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/pull/2472).

##### Disable smart-limit by default and change HARD_MAX_LIMIT

Prior to 0.6.0, `smart-limit` is enabled by default. It tries to guess a small limit
for each graph centric query (e.g. `g.V().has("prop", "value")`) internally, and if more
results are required by user, it queries backend again with a larger limit, and repeats
until either results are exhausted or user stops the query. However, this is not the
same as paging mechanism. All interim results will be fetched again in next round, making
the whole query costly. Even worse, if your data backend does not return results in a consistent order,
then some entries might be missing in the final results. Until JanusGraph can fully utilize
the paging capacity provided by backends (e.g. Elasticsearch scroll), this option is
recommended to be turned off. The exception is when you have a large number of results
but you only need a few of them, then enabling `smart-limit` can reduce latency and memory
usage. An example would be:

```
Iterator<Vertex> iter = graph.traversal().V().has("prop", "value");
while (iter.hasNext()) {
    Vertex v = iter.next();
    if (canStop()) break;
}
```

Prior to 0.6.0, even if `smart-limit` is disabled, JanusGraph adds a `HARD_MAX_LIMIT` that
is equivalent to 100,000 to avoid fetching too many results at a time. This limit is now
configurable, and by default, it's Integer.MAX_VALUE which can be interpreted as no limit.

##### Add experimental support for Java 11

We started to work on support for Java 11. We would like to get feedback,
if everything is working as expected after upgrading to Java 11.

##### Removal of LoggingSchemaMaker

The `schema.default=logging` option is not valid anymore. Use `schema.default=default`
and `schema.logging=true` options together to make application behaviour unaltered,
if you are using `LoggingSchemaMaker`.

##### Replacing the server startup script is replaced

The `gremlin-server.sh` is placed by `janusgraph-server.sh`. The 
`janusgraph-server.sh` brings some new functionality such as easy 
configuration of Java options using the `jvm.options` file.

The `jvm.options` file contains some default configurations for JVM based 
on Cassandra's JVM configurations, Elasticsearch and the old gremlin-server.sh.

##### Serialization of JanusGraph predicates has changed

The serialization of JanusGraph predicates has changed in this version for both 
GraphSON and Gryo. The newest version of the JanusGraph Driver requires a JanusGraph 
Server version of 0.6.0 and above. The server includes a fallback for clients with an 
older driver to make the upgrade to version 0.6.0 easier. This means that the server 
can be upgraded first without having to update all clients at the same time. The 
fallback will however be removed in a future version of JanusGraph so clients should 
also be upgraded.

##### GraphBinary is now supported

[GraphBinary](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/dev/io/#graphbinary) is a 
new binary serialization format from TinkerPop that supersedes Gryo and it will 
eventually also replace GraphSON. GraphBinary is language independent and has a 
low serialization overhead which results in an improved performance.

If you want to use GraphBinary, you have to add following to the `gremlin-server.yaml` 
after the keyword `serializers`. This will add the support on the server site. 

```yaml
    - { className: org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.ser.GraphBinaryMessageSerializerV1, 
        config: { ioRegistries: [org.janusgraph.graphdb.tinkerpop.JanusGraphIoRegistry] }}
    - { className: org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.ser.GraphBinaryMessageSerializerV1, 
        config: { serializeResultToString: true }}
```
!!! note 
    The java driver is the only driver that currently supports GraphBinary, 
    see [Connecting to JanusGraph using Java](basics/connecting/java.md).

!!! note
    Version 1.0.0 moves everything under `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.ser` package to
    `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.util.ser` package.

!!! note
    Version 1.0.0 adds a breaking change to GraphBinary for Geoshape serialization,
    see [the 1.0.0 changelog for more information](#breaking-change-for-geoshape-graphbinary-serialization).

##### New index selection algorithm
In version 0.6.0, the index selection algorithm has changed. If the number of possible
indexes for a query is small enough, the new algorithm will perform an exhaustive search
to minimize the number of indexes which need to be queried. The default limit is set to 10.
In order to maintain the old selection algorithm regardless of the available indexes, set
the key `query.index-select-threshold` to `0`.
For more information, see [Configuration Reference](configs/configuration-reference.md#query)
    
##### Removal of Cassandra Thrift support

Thrift will be completely removed in Cassandra 4.
All deprecated Cassandra Thrift backends were removed in JanusGraph 0.6.0.
We already added support for CQL in JanusGraph 0.2.0 and we have been 
encouraging users to switch from Thrift to CQL since version 0.2.1.

This means that the following backends were removed: 
`cassandrathrift`, `cassandra`, `astyanax`, and `embeddedcassandra`.
Users who still use one of these Thrift backends should migrate to CQL.
[Our migration guide](operations/migrating-thrift.md) explains the 
necessary steps for this. The option to run Cassandra embedded 
in the same JVM as JanusGraph is however no longer supported with CQL.

!!! note 
    The source code for the Thrift backends will be moved into a 
    [dedicated repository](https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph-cassandra).
    While we do not support them any more, users can still use them 
    if they for some reason cannot migrate to CQL.

##### Drop support for Cassandra 2

With the release of Cassandra 4, the support of Cassandra 2 will be dropped. 
Therefore, you should upgrade to Cassandra 3 or higher.

!!! note
    Cassandra 3 and higher doesn't support compact storage. If you have activated 
    or never changed the value of `storage.cql.storage-compact=true`, during the 
    upgrade process you have to ensure your data is correctly migrated.

##### Introduction of a JanusGraph Server startup class as a replacement for Gremlin Server startup

The `gremlin-server.sh` and the `janusgraph.sh` are configured to use the new JanusGraph startup class. 
This new class introduces a default set of TinkerPop Serializers if no serializers are configured in 
the `gremlin-server.yaml`. Furthermore, JanusGraph will log the version of JanusGraph and TinkerPop 
after a shiny new JanusGraph header.

!!! note
    If you have a custom script to startup JanusGraph, you propably would like to replace the Gremlin Server 
    class with JanusGraph Server class: 
    
    `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.GremlinServer` => `org.janusgraph.graphdb.server.JanusGraphServer`

##### Drop support for Ganglia metrics

We are dropping Ganglia as we are using dropwizard for metrics. Dropwizard did drop Ganglia in the newest major version.

##### DataStax cassandra driver upgrade from 3.9.0 to 4.13.0

All DataStax cassandra driver metrics are now disabled by default. To enable DataStax driver metrics you need to provide 
a list of Session level metrics and / or Node level metrics you want to enable. To provide a list of enabled metrics, 
you can use the next configuration options: `storage.cql.metrics.session-enabled` and `storage.cql.metrics.node-enabled`. 
Notice, DataStax metrics are enabled only when basic metrics are enabled (i.e. `metrics.enabled = true`).
See configuration references `storage.cql.metrics` for additional DataStax metrics configuration.

An example configuration which enables some CQL Session level and Node level metrics reporting by JMX:
```properties
metrics.enabled=true
metrics.jmx.enabled=true
metrics.jmx.domain=com.datastax.oss.driver
metrics.jmx.agentid=agent
storage.cql.metrics.session-enabled=bytes-sent,bytes-received,connected-nodes,cql-requests,throttling.delay
storage.cql.metrics.node-enabled=pool.open-connections,pool.available-streams,bytes-sent,cql-messages
```

See `advanced.metrics.session.enabled` and `advanced.metrics.node.enabled` sections in 
[DataStax Metrics Configuration](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.13/manual/core/configuration/reference/) 
for a complete list of available Session level and Node level metrics.

Due to driver upgrade the next cql configuration options have been removed:

* `local-core-connections-per-host`
* `remote-core-connections-per-host`
* `local-max-requests-per-connection`
* `remote-max-requests-per-connection`
* `cluster-name`

`storage.connection-timeout` is now used to control initial connection timeout to CQL storage and not request timeouts. 
Please, use `storage.cql.request-timeout` to configure request timeouts instead.

New cql configuration options should be used for upgrade:

* `max-requests-per-connection`
* `session-name`

`storage.cql.local-datacenter` is mandatory now and defaults to `datacenter1`.

See more new cql configuration options in configuration references under `storage.cql` section.

##### Automatic configurations of dynamic graph binding

If the JanusGraphManager is configured, dynamic graph binding will be setup automatically, 
see [Dynamic Graphs](operations/dynamic-graphs.md).

!!! note 
    Breaking changes in the config of the `gremlin-server.yaml`.

Following, classes are removed and have to be replaced by tinkerpop equivalent:

| removed class | replacement class|
| --- | --- |
| `org.janusgraph.channelizers.JanusGraphWebSocketChannelizer` | `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.channel.WebSocketChannelizer` |
| `org.janusgraph.channelizers.JanusGraphHttpChannelizer` | `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.channel.HttpChannelizer` |
| `org.janusgraph.channelizers.JanusGraphNioChannelizer` | `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.channel.NioChannelizer` |
| `org.janusgraph.channelizers.JanusGraphWsAndHttpChannelizer` | `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.channel.WsAndHttpChannelizer` |

##### Breaking change Lucene and Solr fuzzy predicates

The text predicates `text.textFuzzy` and `text.textContainsFuzzy` have been updated in both the Lucene and Solr indexing
backends to align with JanusGraph and Elastic. These predicates now inspect the query length to determine the Levenshtein
distance, where previously they used the backend's default max distance of 2:

- 0 for strings of one or two characters (exact match)
- 1 for strings of three, four or five characters
- 2 for strings of more than five characters

**Change Matrix:**

| text | query | previous result | new result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ah | ah | true | true |
| ah | ai | true | **false** |
| hop | hop | true | true |
| hop | hap | true | true |
| hop | hoop | true | true |
| hop | hooop | true | **false** |
| surprises | surprises | true | true |
| surprises | surprizes | true | true |
| surprises | surpprises | true | true |
| surprises | surpprisess | false | false |

#### Upgrade Instructions

##### ElasticSearch index store names cache now enabled for any amount of indexes per store

In JanusGraph version `0.5.0` and `0.5.1` all ElasticSearch index store names are cached for efficient index store name 
retrieval and the cache is disabled if there are more than `50000` indexes available per index store. 
From JanusGraph version `0.5.2` index store names cache isn't limited to `50000` but instead can be disabled by using 
a new added parameter `enable_index_names_cache`. It is still recommended to disable index store names cache if more 
than `50000` indexes are used per index store.

#### Upgrade Instructions

##### Two Distributed package is splitted into two version

The default version of the distribution package does no longer contain the `janusgraph.sh`. 
This includes a packaged version of cassandra and elasticsearch. If you want to have `janusgraph.sh`, 
you have to download distribution with the suffix `-full`.

##### Gremlin Server distributed with the release uses inmemory storage backend and no search backend by default

Gremlin Server is by default configured for the inmemory storage backend and no search backend when started with 
`bin/gremlin-server.sh`.  
You can provide configuration for another storage backend and/or search backend by providing a path to the appropriate 
configuration as a second parameter (`./bin/gremlin-server.sh ./conf/gremlin-server/[...].yaml`).

#### Upgrade Instructions

##### Distributed package is renamed

The distribution has no longer the suffix `-hadoop2`.

##### Reorder dependency of Hadoop

Hadoop is now a dependency of supported backends. Therefore, `MapReduceIndexJobs` is now split up into different classes:

| Old Function | New Function |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|`MapReduceIndexJobs.cassandraRepair`|`CassandraMapReduceIndexJobsUtils.repair`| 
|`MapReduceIndexJobs.cassandraRemove`|`CassandraMapReduceIndexJobsUtils.remove`|
|`MapReduceIndexJobs.cqlRepair`|`CqlMapReduceIndexJobsUtils.repair`| 
|`MapReduceIndexJobs.cqlRemove`|`CqlMapReduceIndexJobsUtils.remove`| 
|`MapReduceIndexJobs.hbaseRepair`|`HBaseMapReduceIndexJobsUtils.repair`| 
|`MapReduceIndexJobs.hbaseRemove`|`HBaseMapReduceIndexJobsUtils.remove`| 

!!! note
    Now, you can easily support for any backend.

!!! warning
    `Cassandra3InputFormat` is replaced by `CqlInputFormat`

##### ElasticSearch: Upgrade from 6.6.0 to 7.6.1 and drop support for 5.x version
The ElasticSearch version has been changed to 7.6.1 which removes support for `max-retry-timeout` option. 
That is why this option no longer available in JanusGraph.
Users should be aware that by default JanusGraph setups maximum open scroll contexts to maximum value of `2147483647` with the parameter `setup-max-open-scroll-contexts` for ElasticSearch 7.y. 
This option can be disabled and updated manually in ElasticSearch
but you should be aware that ElasticSearch starting from version 7 has a default limit of 500 opened contexts 
which most likely be reached by the normal usage of JanusGraph with ElasticSearch.
By default deprecated mappings are disabled in ElasticSearch version 7. 
If you are upgrading your ElasticSearch index backend to version 7 from lower versions, 
it is recommended to reindex your JanusGraph indices to not use mappings. 
If you are unable to reindex your indices you may setup parameter `use-mapping-for-es7` to `true` 
which will tell JanusGraph to use mapping types for ElasticSearch version 7.
Due to the drop of support for 5.x version, deprecated multi-type indices are no more supported. 
Parameter `use-deprecated-multitype-index` is no more supported by JanusGraph.

##### BerkeleyDB

BerkeleyDB storage configured with [SHARED_CACHE](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17277_02/html/java/com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentConfig.html#SHARED_CACHE) for better memory usage.

##### Default logging location has changed

If you are using `janusgraph.sh` to start your instance, the default logging has been changed from `log` to `logs`

#### Upgrade Instructions

##### TinkerPop: Upgrade from 3.4.1 to 3.4.4

Adding multiple values in the same query to a new vertex property without explicitly defined type 
(i.e. using `Automatic Schema Maker` to create a property type) requires explicit usage of `VertexProperty.Cardinality` 
for each call (only for the first query which defines a property) if the `VertexProperty.Cardinality` is different than 
`VertexProperty.Cardinality.single`.

#### Upgrade Instructions

##### HBase: Upgrade from 1.2 to 2.1
The version of HBase that is included in the distribution of JanusGraph was upgraded from 1.2.6 to 2.1.5.
HBase 2.x client is not fully backward compatible with HBase 1.x server. Users who operate their own HBase version 1.x cluster may need to upgrade their cluster to version 2.x.
Optionally users may build their own distribution of JanusGraph which includes HBase 1.x from source with the maven flags -Dhbase.profile -Phbase1.

##### Cassandra: Upgrade from 2.1 to 2.2
The version of Cassandra that is included in the distribution of JanusGraph was upgraded from 2.1.20 to 2.2.13.
Refer to [the upgrade documentation of Cassandra](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/174cf761f7897443080b8a840b649b7eab17ae25/NEWS.txt#L787)
for detailed instructions to perform this upgrade.
Users who operate their own Cassandra cluster instead of using Cassandra distributed together with JanusGraph are not affected by this upgrade.
This also does not change the different versions of Cassandra that are supported by JanusGraph (see <<version-compat>> for a detailed list of the supported versions).

##### BerkeleyDB : Upgrade from 7.4 to 7.5
The BerkeleyDB version has been updated, and it contains changes to the file format stored on disk 
(see [the BerkeleyDB changelog for reference](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17277_02/html/changelog.html)).
This file format change is forward compatible with previous versions of BerkeleyDB, so existing graph data stored with JanusGraph can be read in.
However, once the data has been read in with the newer version of BerkeleyDB, those files can no longer be read by the older version.
Users are encouraged to backup the BerkeleyDB storage directory before attempting to use it with the JanusGraph release.

##### Solr: Compatible Lucene version changed from 5.0.0 to 7.0.0 in distributed config
The JanusGraph distribution contains a `solrconfig.xml` file that can be used to configure Solr.
The value `luceneMatchVersion` in this config that tells Solr to behave according to that Lucene version was changed from 5.0.0 to 7.0.0 as that is the default version currently used by JanusGraph.
Users should generally set this value to the version of their Solr installation.
If the config distributed by JanusGraph is used for an existing Solr installation that used a lower version before (like 5.0.0 from a previous versions of this file), it is highly recommended that a re-indexing is performed.

#### Upgrade Instructions

!!! important
    You should back-up your data prior to attempting an upgrade! Also please note that once an upgrade has been completed you will no longer be able to connect to your graph with client versions prior to 0.3.0.

JanusGraph 0.3.0 implements [Schema Constraints](./schema/index.md#schema-constraints) which made it necessary to also introduce the concept of a schema version. There is a check to prevent client connections that either expect a different schema version or have no concept of a schema version. To perform an upgrade, the configuration option `graph.allow-upgrade=true` must be set on each graph you wish to upgrade. The graph must be opened with a 0.3.0 or greater version of JanusGraph since older versions have no concept of `graph.storage-version` and will not allow for it to be set.

Example excerpt from `janusgraph.properties` file
```properties
# JanusGraph configuration sample: Cassandra over a socket
#
# This file connects to a Cassandra daemon running on localhost via
# Thrift.  Cassandra must already be started before starting JanusGraph
# with this file.

# This option should be removed as soon as the upgrade is complete. Otherwise if this file
# is used in the future to connect to a different graph it could cause an unintended upgrade.
graph.allow-upgrade=true

gremlin.graph=org.janusgraph.core.JanusGraphFactory

# The primary persistence provider used by JanusGraph.  This is required.
# It should be set one of JanusGraph's built-in shorthand names for its
# standard storage backends (shorthands: berkeleyje, cassandrathrift,
# cassandra, astyanax, embeddedcassandra, cql, hbase, inmemory) or to the
# full package and classname of a custom/third-party StoreManager
# implementation.
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.backend=cassandrathrift

# The hostname or comma-separated list of hostnames of storage backend
# servers.  This is only applicable to some storage backends, such as
# cassandra and hbase.
#
# Default:    127.0.0.1
# Data Type:  class java.lang.String[]
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.hostname=127.0.0.1
```

If `graph.allow-upgrade` is set to true on a graph `graph.storage-version` and `graph.janusgraph-version` will automatically be upgraded to match the version level of the server, or local client, that is opening the graph.
You can verify the upgrade was successful by opening the management API and validating the values of `graph.storage-version` and `graph.janusgraph-version`.

Once the storage version has been set you should remove `graph.allow-upgrade=true` from your properties file and reopen your graph to ensure that the upgrade was successful.

#### Upgrade Instructions
##### HBase TTL

In JanusGraph 0.2.0, time-to-live (TTL) support was added for HBase
storage backend. In order to utilize the TTL capability on HBase, the
graph timestamps need to be MILLI. If the `graph.timestamps` property is
not explicitly set to MILLI, the default is MICRO in JanusGraph 0.2.0,
which does not work for HBase TTL. Since the `graph.timestamps` property
is FIXED, a new graph needs to be created to make any change of the
`graph.timestamps` property effective.

#### Upgrade Instructions

##### Elasticsearch

JanusGraph 0.1.z is compatible with Elasticsearch 1.5.z. There were
several configuration options available, including transport client,
node client, and legacy configuration track. JanusGraph 0.2.0 is
compatible with Elasticsearch versions from 1.y through 6.y, however it
offers only a single configuration option using the REST client.

##### Transport client

The `TRANSPORT_CLIENT` interface has been replaced with `REST_CLIENT`.
When migrating an existing graph to JanusGraph 0.2.0, the `interface`
property must be set when connecting to the graph:
```properties
index.search.backend=elasticsearch
index.search.elasticsearch.interface=REST_CLIENT
index.search.hostname=127.0.0.1
```

After connecting to the graph, the property update can be made permanent
by making the change with `JanusGraphManagement`:
```groovy
mgmt = graph.openManagement()
mgmt.set("index.search.elasticsearch.interface", "REST_CLIENT")
mgmt.commit()
```

##### Node client

A node client with JanusGraph can be configured in a few ways. If the
node client was configured as a client-only or non-data node, follow the
steps from the [transport client](#_transport_client) section to connect
to the existing cluster using the `REST_CLIENT` instead. If the node
client was a data node (local-mode), then convert it into a standalone
Elasticsearch node, running in a separate JVM from your application
process. This can be done by using the node’s configuration from the
JanusGraph configuration to start a standalone Elasticsearch 1.5.z node.
For example, we start with these JanusGraph 0.1.z properties:

    index.search.backend=elasticsearch
    index.search.elasticsearch.interface=NODE
    index.search.conf-file=es-client.yml
    index.search.elasticsearch.ext.node.name=alice

where the configuration file `es-client.yml` has properties:

    node.data: true
    path.data: /var/lib/elasticsearch/data
    path.work: /var/lib/elasticsearch/work
    path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch

The properties found in the configuration file `es-client.yml` and the
`index.search.elasticsearch.ext.*` properties can be inserted into
`$ES_HOME/config/elasticsearch.yml` so that a standalone Elasticsearch
1.5.z node can be started with the same properties. Keep in mind that if
any `path` locations have relative paths, those values may need to be
updated appropriately. Once the standalone Elasticsearch node is
started, follow the directions in the [transport
client](#_transport_client) section to complete the migration to the
`REST_CLIENT` interface. Note that the `index.search.conf-file` and
`index.search.elasticsearch.ext.*` properties are not used by the
`REST_CLIENT` interface, so they can be removed from the configuration
properties.

##### Legacy configuration

The legacy configuration track was not recommended in JanusGraph 0.1.z
and is no longer supported in JanusGraph 0.2.0. Users should refer to
the previous sections and migrate to the `REST_CLIENT`.

#### Upgrade Instructions

JanusGraph is based on the latest commit to the `titan11` branch of
[Titan repo](https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan).

JanusGraph has made the following changes to Titan, so you will need to
adjust your code and configuration accordingly:

1.  module names: `titan-*` are now `janusgraph-*`

2.  package names: `com.thinkaurelius.titan` are now `org.janusgraph`

3.  class names: `Titan*` are now `JanusGraph*` except in cases where
    this would duplicate a word, e.g., `TitanGraph` is simply
    `JanusGraph` rather than `JanusGraphGraph`

For more information on how to configure JanusGraph to read data which
had previously been written by Titan refer to [Migration from titan](operations/migrating-titan.md).
