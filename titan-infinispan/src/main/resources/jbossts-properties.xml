    <!--
This is the JBossTS configuration file for running ArjunaJTA.
It should be called jbossts-properties.xml.
You need a different version for ArjunaCore or JTS usage.

***************************

Property values may be literals or be tokens of the form ${p1[,p2][:v]}
in which case the token values are substituted for the values of the corresponding system
properties as follows:

- Any occurance of ${p} with the System.getProperty(p) value.
If there is no such property p defined, then the ${p} reference will remain unchanged.

- If the property reference is of the form ${p:v} and there is no such property p,
then the default value v will be returned.

- If the property reference is of the form ${p1,p2} or ${p1,p2:v} then
the primary and the secondary properties will be tried in turn, before
returning either the unchanged input, or the default value.

The property ${/} is replaced with System.getProperty("file.separator")
value and the property ${:} is replaced with System.getProperty("path.separator").

Note this substitution applies to property values only at the point they are read from
the config file. Tokens in system properties won't be substituted.

Base port number for determining a unique number to associate with an instance of the transaction service
(which is needed in order to support multiple instances on the same machine).
Use the value 0 to allow the system to select the first available port number.
If the port number is non-zero and the port is in use then the value will be incremented until either a successful binding
to the loopback address is created or until the the maximum number of ports (specified by the
CoreEnvironmentBean.socketProcessIdMaxPorts property) have been tried or until the port number
reaches the maximum possible port number.

    <!--
For cases where the recovery manager is in process with the transaction manager and nothing else uses
the ObjectStore, it is possible to disable the socket based recovery listener by setting this to NO.
Caution: use of this property can allow multiple recovery processes to run on the same ObjectStore
if you are not careful. That in turn can lead to incorrect transaction processing. Use with care.
