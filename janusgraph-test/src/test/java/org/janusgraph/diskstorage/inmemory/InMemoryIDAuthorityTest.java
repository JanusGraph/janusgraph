     * call to {@code openStorageManager} and they will all satisfy this
     * constraint, since every manager opens with the same config and talks to
     * the same service. It's not really necessary to have separate managers,
     * but it's nice for getting an extra bit of test coverage. However,
     * separate in-memory managers wouldn't be able to see one another's
     * reads/writes, so we just open a single manager and store it here.
