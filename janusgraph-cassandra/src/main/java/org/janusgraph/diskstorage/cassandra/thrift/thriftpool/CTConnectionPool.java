/**
 * This class extends Apache Commons Pool's GenericKeyedObjectPool, adding
 * two methods that support Java 5 generic type safety.  However, a
 * programmer can still cause RuntimeExceptions related to type errors
 * by mixing calls to these additional methods with calls to the legacy
 * "Object"-typed methods.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Unfortunately, GenericKeyedObjectPool is not actually generic in the
 * type-system sense.  All of its methods are typed to Object, forcing the
 * client programmer to sprinkle code with casts.  This class centralizes
 * that casting to a single method.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * As a corollary, this class is slightly less flexible than
 * GenericKeyedObjectPool, as this class can only store keys and pooled
 * objects each of a single type, whereas GenericKeyedObjectPool could
 * theoretically contain heterogeneous types of each.  However, I do not
 * need the flexibility of heterogeneous types for pooling Thrift
 * connections, the original work that precipitated writing this class.
