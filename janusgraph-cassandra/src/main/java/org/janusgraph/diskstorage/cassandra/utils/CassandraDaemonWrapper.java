/**
 * This class starts a Thrift CassandraDaemon inside the current JVM. This class
 * supports testing and shouldn't be used in production.
 *
 * This class starts Cassandra on the first invocation of
 * {@link CassandraDaemonWrapper#start(String)} in the life of the JVM.
 * Invocations after the first have no effect except that they may log a
 * warning.
 *
 * When the thread that first called {@code #start(String)} dies, a daemon
 * thread returns from {@link Thread#join()} and kills all embedded Cassandra
 * threads in the JVM.
 *
 * This class once supported consecutive, idempotent calls to start(String) so
 * long as the argument was the same in each invocation. It also once used
 * reference counting to kill Cassandra's non-daemon threads once stop() was called as
 * many times as start(). Some of Cassandra's background threads and statics
 * can't be easily reset to allow a restart inside the same JVM, so this was
 * intended as a one-use thing. However, this interacts poorly with the new
 * KCVConfiguration system in janusgraph-core. When KCVConfiguration is in use, core
 * starts and stops each backend at least twice in the course of opening a
 * single database instance. So the old reference counting and killing approach is out.
