Move a region.  Optionally specify target regionserver else we choose one
at random.  NOTE: You pass the encoded region name, not the region name so
this command is a little different to the others.  The encoded region name
is the hash suffix on region names: e.g. if the region name were
TestTable,0094429456,1289497600452.527db22f95c8a9e0116f0cc13c680396. then
the encoded region name portion is 527db22f95c8a9e0116f0cc13c680396
A server name is its host, port plus startcode. For example:
host187.example.com,60020,1289493121758
Examples:

  hbase> move 'ENCODED_REGIONNAME'
  hbase> move 'ENCODED_REGIONNAME', 'SERVER_NAME'
EOF
      end

      def command(encoded_region_name, server_name = nil)
        format_simple_command do
          admin.move(encoded_region_name, server_name)
        end
      end
    end
