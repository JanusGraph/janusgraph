# JanusGraph configuration sample: Cassandra & Elasticsearch over sockets
#
# This file connects to Cassandra and Elasticsearch services running
# on localhost over the CQL API and the Elasticsearch native
# "Transport" API on their respective default ports.  The Cassandra
# and Elasticsearch services must already be running before starting
# JanusGraph with this file.

# The primary persistence provider used by JanusGraph.  This is required.  It
# should be set one of JanusGraph's built-in shorthand names for its standard
# storage backends or to the full package and classname of a custom/third-party
# StoreManager implementation.
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.backend = cql

# The hostname or comma-separated list of hostnames of storage backend
# servers.  This is only applicable to some storage backends, such as
# cassandra and hbase.
#
# Default:    127.0.0.1
# Data Type:  class java.lang.String[]
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.hostname = cassandra

# The name of JanusGraph's keyspace.  It will be created if it does not
# exist.
#
# Default:    janusgraph
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL

# Whether to enable JanusGraph's database-level cache, which is shared across
# all transactions. Enabling this option speeds up traversals by holding
# hot graph elements in memory, but also increases the likelihood of
# reading stale data.  Disabling it forces each transaction to
# independently fetch graph elements from storage before reading/writing
# them.
#
# Default:    false
# Data Type:  Boolean
# Mutability: MASKABLE
cache.db-cache = true

# How long, in milliseconds, database-level cache will keep entries after
# flushing them.  This option is only useful on distributed storage
# backends that are capable of acknowledging writes without necessarily
# making them immediately visible.
#
# Default:    50
# Data Type:  Integer
# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE
#
# Settings with mutability GLOBAL_OFFLINE are centrally managed in JanusGraph's
# storage backend.  After starting the database for the first time, this
# file's copy of this setting is ignored.  Use JanusGraph's Management System
# to read or modify this value after bootstrapping.
cache.db-cache-clean-wait = 20

# Default expiration time, in milliseconds, for entries in the
# database-level cache. Entries are evicted when they reach this age even
# if the cache has room to spare. Set to 0 to disable expiration (cache
# entries live forever or until memory pressure triggers eviction when set
# to 0).

# Default:    10000
# Data Type:  Long

# Size of JanusGraph's database level cache.  Values between 0 and 1 are
# interpreted as a percentage of VM heap, while larger values are
# interpreted as an absolute size in bytes.

# Default:    0.3
# Data Type:  Double
# Mutability: MASKABLE
