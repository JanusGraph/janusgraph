# The primary persistence provider used by JanusGraph.  This is required.  It
# should be set one of JanusGraph's built-in shorthand names for its standard
# storage backends or to the full package and classname of a custom/third-party
# StoreManager implementation.
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL

# Storage directory for those storage backends that require local storage.

# Mutability: LOCAL

# The indexing backend used to extend and optimize JanusGraph's query
# functionality. This setting is optional.  JanusGraph can use multiple
# heterogeneous index backends.  Hence, this option can appear more than
# once, so long as the user-defined name between "index" and "backend" is
# unique among appearances.Similar to the storage backend, this should be
# set to one of JanusGraph's built-in shorthand names for its standard
# index backends (shorthands: lucene, elasticsearch, es, solr) or to the
# full package and classname of a custom/third-party IndexProvider
# implementation.
#
# Default:    elasticsearch
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE
#
# Settings with mutability GLOBAL_OFFLINE are centrally managed in
# JanusGraph's storage backend.  After starting the database for the first
# time, this file's copy of this setting is ignored.  Use JanusGraph's
# Management System to read or modify this value after bootstrapping.

# Directory to store index data locally

# Default:    (no default value)
