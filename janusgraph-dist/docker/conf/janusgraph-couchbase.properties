# JanusGraph configuration sample: Couchbase
#
# This file connects to a local Couchbase instance.
# Couchbase must already be started before starting JanusGraph
# with this file.

# The primary persistence provider used by JanusGraph.  This is required.
# It should be set one of JanusGraph's built-in shorthand names for its
# standard storage backends (shorthands: berkeleyje, cassandrathrift,
# cassandra, astyanax, embeddedcassandra, cql, hbase, foundationdb, couchbase,
# inmemory) or to the full package and classname of a custom/third-party
# StoreManager implementation.
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL

# Whether to enable JanusGraph's database-level cache, which is shared
# across all transactions. Enabling this option speeds up traversals by
# holding hot graph elements in memory, but also increases the likelihood
# of reading stale data.  Disabling it forces each transaction to
# independently fetch graph elements from storage before reading/writing
# them.
#
# Default:    false
# Data Type:  Boolean
# Mutability: MASKABLE
cache.db-cache = false

# How long, in milliseconds, database-level cache will keep entries after
# flushing them.  This option is only useful on distributed storage
# backends that are capable of acknowledging writes without necessarily
# making them immediately visible.
#
# Default:    50
# Data Type:  Integer
# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE
#
# Settings with mutability GLOBAL_OFFLINE are centrally managed in
# JanusGraph's storage backend.  After starting the database for the first
# time, this file's copy of this setting is ignored.  Use JanusGraph's
# Management System to read or modify this value after bootstrapping.
cache.db-cache-clean-wait = 20

# Default expiration time, in milliseconds, for entries in the
# database-level cache. Entries are evicted when they reach this age even
# if the cache has room to spare. Set to 0 to disable expiration (cache
# entries live forever or until memory pressure triggers eviction when set
# to 0).
#
# Default:    10000
# Data Type:  Long
# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE
#
# Settings with mutability GLOBAL_OFFLINE are centrally managed in

# Management System to read or modify this value after bootstrapping.

# Size of JanusGraph's database level cache.  Values between 0 and 1 are
# interpreted as a percentage of VM heap, while larger values are
# interpreted as an absolute size in bytes.

# Default:    0.3
# Data Type:  Double
# Mutability: MASKABLE

# Turn on storage adapter query parallelization

# The isolation level for the Couchbase storage adapter. This configuration
# is setup for interactive console sessions so it allows for writes that
# can span more than the lifespan of one single Couchbase transaction.
# It is recommended that this be set to serializable or read_committed_no_write
# for production scenarios to maintain referential integrity.
