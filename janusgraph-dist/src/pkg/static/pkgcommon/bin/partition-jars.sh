# Partition JanusGraph's dependency set to support modular packaging.
#
# Dependencies used in more than one module ("used" directly or
# indirectly through an arbitrary degree of transitivity) go into a
# partition cell called main.  Dependencies that appear in exactly one
# module go into a cell named after the module.  The list of
# dependencies in each cell are written to the files
# dep-part-<cellname>.txt in the repo root.
#
# The point of all this is to determine which jars should go into
# which .deb or .rpm subpackage.  I don't think Maven's dependency or
# assembly plugins are currently capable of doing this computation
# natively, so I wrote this script.

# This is a hack for Lucene and ES.  Every Lucene jar used by janusgraph-lucene
# is also used by janusgraph-es, so those go into janusgraph-main.  Some additional
# Lucene jars are used only by janusgraph-es, so those go into janusgraph-es.  The
# result is a completely empty dep-lucene.txt file with Lucene jars split
# between dep-es.txt and dep-part-main.txt.  It's technically the intended
# result of the partition algorithm, but it's also utterly nonsensical from
# a practical point of view.

# janusgraph-lucene subpackage for this to work.
