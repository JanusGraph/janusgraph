# JanusGraph configuration sample: HBase and Elasticsearch
#
# This file connects to HBase using a Zookeeper quorum
# (storage.hostname) consisting solely of localhost.  It also connects
# to Elasticsearch running on localhost over Elasticsearch's native "Transport"
# protocol.  Zookeeper, the HBase services, and Elasticsearch must already 
# be running and available before starting JanusGraph with this file.
