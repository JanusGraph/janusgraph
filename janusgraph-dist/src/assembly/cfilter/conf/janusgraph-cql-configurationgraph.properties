# JanusGraph configuration sample: Cassandra over a socket
#
# This file connects to a Cassandra daemon running on localhost via
# CQL.  Cassandra must already be started before starting JanusGraph
# with this file.

gremlin.graph=org.janusgraph.core.ConfiguredGraphFactory

# The primary persistence provider used by JanusGraph.  This is required. 
# It should be set one of JanusGraph's built-in shorthand names for its
# standard storage backends (shorthands: berkeleyje, cql, cassandrathrift,
# cassandra, astyanax, embeddedcassandra, hbase, inmemory) or to the full
# package and classname of a custom/third-party StoreManager
# implementation.
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.backend=cql

# The configuration management graph reserved for use with JanusGraphManager
# and ConfiguredGraphFactory
graph.graphname=ConfigurationManagementGraph
# The hostname or comma-separated list of hostnames of storage backend
# servers.  This is only applicable to some storage backends, such as
# cassandra and hbase.

# Default:    127.0.0.1
# Data Type:  class java.lang.String[]

# Whether to enable JanusGraph's database-level cache, which is shared
# across all transactions. Enabling this option speeds up traversals by
# holding hot graph elements in memory, but also increases the likelihood
# of reading stale data.  Disabling it forces each transaction to
# independently fetch graph elements from storage before reading/writing
# them.
#
# Default:    false
# Data Type:  Boolean
# Mutability: MASKABLE

# How long, in milliseconds, database-level cache will keep entries after
# flushing them.  This option is only useful on distributed storage
# backends that are capable of acknowledging writes without necessarily
# making them immediately visible.

# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE

# Settings with mutability GLOBAL_OFFLINE are centrally managed in

# Management System to read or modify this value after bootstrapping.

# Default expiration time, in milliseconds, for entries in the
# database-level cache. Entries are evicted when they reach this age even
# if the cache has room to spare. Set to 0 to disable expiration (cache
# entries live forever or until memory pressure triggers eviction when set
# to 0).
