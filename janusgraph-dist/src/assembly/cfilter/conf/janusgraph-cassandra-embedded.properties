# JanusGraph configuration sample: embedded Cassandra
#
# This file starts a Cassandra daemon in the same JVM as JanusGraph and
# talks to it using direct Java method calls.
#
# The embedded Cassandra backend is not officially publicly supported.
# The cassandrathrift and astyanax backends -- which connect to
# Cassandra over its Thrift API -- are supported alternatives.w
