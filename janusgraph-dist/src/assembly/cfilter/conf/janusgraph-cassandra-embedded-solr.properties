# JanusGraph configuration sample: embedded Cassandra & External Solr
#
# This file starts a Cassandra daemon inside the same JVM running JanusGraph and
# connects to Solr services running on localhost using the Solr HTTP API.
# The Cassandra daemon is started automatically. This is sometimes convenient
# for testing. Large production deployments typically opt to provision and
# configure these services separately instead of embedding as shown in this
# file.
#
# The embedded Cassandra backend is not officially publicly supported.
# The cassandrathrift and astyanax backends -- which connect to
# Cassandra over its Thrift API -- are supported alternatives.
