# JanusGraph configuration sample: embedded Cassandra & Elasticsearch
#
# This file starts a Cassandra daemon and an Elasticsearch daemon
# inside the same JVM running JanusGraph.  The daemons are started
# automatically.  This is sometimes convenient for testing.  Large
# production deployments typically opt to provision and configure
# these services separately instead of embedding as shown in this
# file.
#
# The embedded Cassandra backend is not officially publicly supported.
# The cassandrathrift and astyanax backends -- which connect to
# Cassandra over its Thrift API -- are supported alternatives.w
