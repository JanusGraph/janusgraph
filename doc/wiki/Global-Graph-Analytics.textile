Titan is designed to compute numerous, concurrent, short-lived, local graph traversals. Titan is _not_ designed for global graph analysis. In order to understand the difference, a itemization of each term above is defined below.

  * *Numerous concurrent interactions*: the graph is being queried, in parallel, by different users solving different problems.
  * *Short-lived transactions*: each interaction with Titan is intended to be real-time on the order of hundreds of milliseconds.
  * *Local graph traversals*: each transaction is touching a small fraction of the entire graph and as such is solving a problem within a localized region of the graph. 

h2. Faunus: Graph Analytics Engine

Titan is a multi-client database in the classic sense. For performing global graph analytics, Titan relies on "Faunus":http://thinkaurelius.github.com/faunus/. Faunus is a batch processing framework that is optimized for computing a small number of concurrent, long running, global graph traversals.

Please review Faunus documentation for instructions on how to connect "Titan to Faunus":https://github.com/thinkaurelius/faunus/wiki/Titan-Format. However, a short example is provided below. With Faunus it is possible to use Titan as the source of a "Hadoop":hadoop.apache.org MapReduce job chain. Like Titan, Faunus uses Gremlin as its traversal language. However, Faunus compiles its Gremlin statements down to MapReduce jobs. Assume the Titan/Cassandra maintains _The Graph of the Gods_. The Faunus/Gremlin shell can be used to create a @FaunusGraph@. When the traversal is evaluated, Titan serves as the data source and Hadoop serves as the data processing system.
