- [ ] Does your PR body contain #xyz where xyz is the issue number you are trying to resolve?
- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?
- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?

### For code changes:
- [ ] Have you written and/or updated unit tests to verify your changes?
- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?
- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE.txt file, including the main LICENSE.txt file in the root of this repository?

### For documentation related changes:
- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?
- [ ] If this PR is a documentation-only change, have you added a `[skip ci]`
  tag to the first line of your commit message to avoid spending CPU cycles in
  Travis CI when no code, tests, or build configuration are modified?

### Note:
Please ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check Travis CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.
