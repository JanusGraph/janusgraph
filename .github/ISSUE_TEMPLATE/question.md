Hey, stop right there!

We use GitHub to track feature requests and bug reports. Please do not submit issues for questions about how to use JanusGraph, how to set JanusGraph up, best practices, or development related help.

However, we do want to help! Head on over to our mailing lists and ask
your questions there. In additional to awesome, knowledgeable community
contributors, core JanusGraph developers check the mailing list.

General questions regarding the Gremlin graph traversal language in general should be raised in the [Gremlin users group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gremlin-users).

Mailing list for troubleshooting, usage, setup, or best practices is [janusgraph-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/janusgraph-users).
Mailing list for internal implementation details of JanusGraph, proposing a major new feature or subproject, or development-related help is [janusgraph-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/janusgraph-dev) (do not post usage questions or bug reports in this thread).


You could also post your question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/janusgraph) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/janusgraph/janusgraph)

We can't stop you from opening an issue here, but it will likely linger without a response for days or weeks. Save yourself the time, and ask on our mailing lists today.
