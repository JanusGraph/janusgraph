JanusGraph is a highly scalable [graph database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) optimized for storing and querying large graphs with billions of vertices and edges distributed across a multi-machine cluster. JanusGraph is a transactional database that can support thousands of concurrent users, complex traversals, and analytic graph queries.
