JanusGraph is a highly scalable [graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database)
optimized for storing and querying large graphs with billions of vertices and edges
distributed across a multi-machine cluster. JanusGraph is a transactional database that
can support thousands of concurrent users, complex traversals, and analytic graph queries.
