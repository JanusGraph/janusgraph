Testing JanusGraph
==================

### Audience of this Document

This page is written for developers familiar with Java, JanusGraph, and Maven who want information on how to run JanusGraph's test suite.

### Overview

JanusGraph runs all tests using JUnit.  To compile, package, and run the default test suite for JanusGraph, use the standard `mvn clean install` command.

JanusGraph has a specialty tests, disabled by default, intended to generate basic performance metrics or stress its cache structures under memory pressure.  The next section describes how JanusGraph's tests are internally categorized and the Maven options that enabled/disable test categories.

### Continuous Integration

JanusGraph runs continuous integration via Travis; see the [dashboard](https://travis-ci.org/JanusGraph/janusgraph) for current status.

Travis sends emails on test failures and status transitions (to/from failure) to
[janusgraph-ci@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/janusgraph-ci) mailing list.

### JUnit Test Categories

All of JanusGraph's tests are written for JUnit.  JanusGraph's JUnit tests are annotated with the following [JUnit Categories](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Categories):


| Category Name | Maven Property | Default | Comment |
| ------------- | ------------------- |:------------:| ------- |
| MemoryTests | test.skip.mem | true (disabled) | Tests intended to exert memory pressure |
| PerformanceTests | test.skip.perf | true (disabled) | Tests written as simple speed tests using JUnitBenchmarks|
| OrderedKeyStoreTests | test.skip.ordered | false (enabled) | Tests written for a storage backend that stores data in key order |
| UnorderedKeyStoreTests | test.skip.unordered | false (enabled) | Tests written for a storage backend that doesn't store data in key order |
| (No&nbsp;category) | test.skip.default | false (enabled) | Tests without any Category annotations |

**Category Name** above is a Java interface defined in the package [org.janusgraph.testcategory](janusgraph-test/src/main/org/janusgraph/testcategory).  These interfaces appear as arguments to the JUnit `@Category(...)` annotation, e.g. `@Category({MemoryTests.class})`.

**Maven Property** above is a boolean-valued pom.xml property that skips the associated test category when true and executes the associated test category when false.  The default values defined in pom.xml can be overridden on the command-line in the ordinary Maven way, e.g. `mvn -Dtest.skip.mem=false test`.

*Implementation Note.*  The Maven property naming pattern "test.skip.x=boolean" is needlessly verbose, a cardinal sin for command line options.  A more concise alternative would be "test.x" with the boolean sense negated.  However, this complicates the pom.xml configuration for the Surefire plugin since it precludes direct use of the Surefire plugin's `<skip>` configuration tag, as in `<skip>${test.skip.perf}</skip>`.  There doesn't seem to be a straightforward way to negate a boolean or otherwise make this easy, at least without resorting to profiles or a custom plugin, though I might be missing something.  Also, the mold is arguably already set by Surefire's "maven.test.skip" property, though that has slightly different interpretation semantics than the properties above.

### Running a Single Test via Maven

The standard maven-surefire-plugin option applies for most tests:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=full.or.partial.classname#methodname
```

However, MemoryTests and PerformanceTests are disabled by default regardless of whatever `-Dtest=...` option might be specified.  When running a single MemoryTest or PerformanceTest, specify `-Dtest.mem=true` or `-Dtest.perf=true` as appropriate for the test in question.

Here's a concrete example.

```bash
# Executes no tests because the MemoryTests category is disabled by default
mvn test -Dtest=BerkeleyJEGraphPerformanceMemoryTest
# Executes the specified test
mvn test -Dtest=BerkeleyJEGraphPerformanceMemoryTest -Dtest.skip.mem=false
```

### Running Solr Tests with External Server

Solr tests can be run using an external Solr server using Docker with [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```bash
# optionally update the solr image version in the compose file prior to starting
docker-compose -f janusgraph-solr/src/test/resources/docker-compose.yml up
```

Monitor container logs and wait until the setup container exits (message will be `resources_janusgraph_solr_test_setup_1 exited with code 0`). Once setup is complete run janusgraph-solr tests with the `index.search.solr.zookeeper-url` property.

```bash
mvn clean install -pl janusgraph-solr -Dindex.search.solr.zookeeper-url=localhost:2181
```

### Running Thrift/CQL tests with ScyllaDB (requires Docker)

To run Thrift or CQL tests with the [ScyllaDB](http://www.scylladb.com/) backend, ensure Docker is running and run tests under the `scylladb-test` Maven profile.

```bash
mvn clean install -pl janusgraph-cql -Pscylladb-test
```

### Running Elasticsearch tests against managed Docker container

To run Elasicsearch tests using an embedded Elasticsearch Docker container, use the `es-docker` profile

```bash
mvn clean install -pl janusgraph-es -Pes-docker
```
