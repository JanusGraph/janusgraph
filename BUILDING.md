Building JanusGraph
--------------

Required:

* Java 8
* Maven 3

To build without executing tests:

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
```

To build with default tests:

```
mvn clean install
```

To build with default plus TinkerPop tests:

```
mvn clean install -Dtest.skip.tp=false
```

To build with only the TinkerPop tests:

```
mvn clean install -Dtest.skip.tp=false -DskipTests=true
```

To build the distribution archive:

```
mvn clean install -Pjanusgraph-release -Dgpg.skip=true -DskipTests=true
```
This command generates the distribution archive in `janusgraph-dist/janusgraph-dist-hadoop-2/target/janusgraph-$VERSION-hadoop2.zip`.
For more details information, please see [here](janusgraph-dist/README.md#building-zip-archives)

## Building Docker Image for JanusGraph Gremlin Server

In order to build Docker image for JanusGraph Gremlin Server, a
distribution archive is needed. Refer to `To build the distribution archive`
section to build the distribution archive first. Then use the following command
to build and run Docker images with JanusGraph and Gremlin Server, configured
to run the BerkeleyJE backend and Elasticsearch (requires [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)):

```bash
mvn docker:build -Pjanusgraph-docker -pl janusgraph-dist
docker-compose -f janusgraph-dist/janusgraph-dist-hadoop-2/docker-compose.yml up
```

Note the above `docker-compose` call launches containers in the foreground and is convenient for monitoring logs but add "-d" to instead run in the background.

To connect to the server in the same container on the console:

```bash
docker exec -i -t janusgraph /var/janusgraph/bin/gremlin.sh
```

Then you can interact with the graph on the console through the `:remote` interface:

```groovy
gremlin> :remote connect tinkerpop.server conf/remote.yaml
==>Configured localhost/127.0.0.1:8182
gremlin> :remote console
==>All scripts will now be sent to Gremlin Server - [localhost/127.0.0.1:8182] - type ':remote console' to return to local mode
gremlin> GraphOfTheGodsFactory.load(graph)
==>null
gremlin> g = graph.traversal()
==>graphtraversalsource[standardjanusgraph[berkeleyje:db/berkeley], standard]
```

## Building on Eclipse IDE
Note that this has only been tested on Eclipse Neon.2 Release (4.6.2) with m2e (1.7.0.20160603-1933) and m2e-wtp (1.3.1.20160831-1005) plugin.


To build without executing tests:

1. Right-click on your project -> "Run As..." -> "Run Configurations..."
2. On "Goals", populate with `install`
3. Select the options `Update Snapshots` and `Skip Tests`
4. Before clicking "Run", make sure that Eclipse knows where `JAVA_HOME` is. On same window, go to "Environment" tab and click "New".
5. Under "Name:", add `JAVA_HOME`
6. Under "Value:", add the path where `java` is located
7. Click "OK"
8. Then click "Run"

To find the Java binary in your environment, run the appropriate command for your operating system:
* Linux/macOS: `which java`
* Windows: `for %i in (java.exe) do @echo. %~$PATH:i`
