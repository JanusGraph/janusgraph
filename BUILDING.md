Building JanusGraph
--------------

Required:

* Java 7 (0.5 and earlier) or Java 8 (0.9 and later)
* Maven

To build without executing tests:

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
```

To build with default tests:

```
mvn clean install
```

To build with default plus TinkerPop tests:

```
mvn clean install -Dtest.skip.tp=false
```

To build with only the TinkerPop tests:

```
mvn clean install -Dtest.skip.tp=false -DskipTests=true
```

## Building on Eclipse IDE
Note that this has only been tested on Eclipse Neon.2 Release (4.6.2) with m2e (1.7.0.20160603-1933) and m2e-wtp (1.3.1.20160831-1005) plugin.


To build without executing tests:

1. Right-click on your project -> "Run As..." -> "Run Configurations..."
2. On "Goals", populate with `install`
3. Select the options `Update Snapshots` and `Skip Tests`
4. Before clicking "Run", make sure that Eclipse knows where `JAVA_HOME` is. On same window, go to "Environment" tab and click "New".
5. Under "Name:", add `JAVA_HOME`
6. Under "Value:", add the path where `java` is located
7. Click "OK"
8. Then click "Run"

To find the Java binary in your environment, run the appropriate command for your operating system:
* Linux/macOS: `which java`
* Windows: `for %i in (java.exe) do @echo. %~$PATH:i`
