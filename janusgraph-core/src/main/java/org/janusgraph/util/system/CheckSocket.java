/*
 *  This doesn't really belong here.  It's only used in the zipfile
 *  distribution to check whether Gremlin Server or ES are listening on
 *  their respective TCP ports.    But it's so tiny that I don't want
 *  to reorganize the repo to accommodate it (yet).
 *
 *  Many widely available *NIX programs do this task better (e.g.
 *  netcat, telnet, nmap, socat, ... we could even use netstat since
 *  we're interested only in the status of local ports).  But we want
 *  to keep the JanusGraph distribution self-contained insofar as is
 *  reasonable.
