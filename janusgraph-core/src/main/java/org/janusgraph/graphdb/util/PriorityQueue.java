   * assume it's full and only change the top without attempting to insert any new

   * By default, this method returns false, which means the queue will not be
   * filled with sentinel values. Otherwise, the value returned will be used to
   * pre-populate the queue. Adds sentinel values to the queue.<br>
   *

   * // extends getSentinelObject() to return a non-null value.
   * PriorityQueue&lt;MyObject&gt; pq = new MyQueue&lt;MyObject&gt;(numHits);
   * // save the 'top' element, which is guaranteed to not be null.
   * MyObject pqTop = pq.top();
   * &lt;...&gt;
   * // now in order to add a new element, which is 'better' than top (after 
   * // you've verified it is better), it is as simple as:
   * pqTop.change().
   * pqTop = pq.updateTop();
   * </pre>
   * 
   * <b>NOTE:</b> if this method returns a non-null value, it will be called by
   * the {@link PriorityQueue#PriorityQueue(int,boolean)} constructor 
   * {@link #size()} times, relying on a new object to be returned and will not
   * check if it's null again. Therefore you should ensure any call to this
   * method creates a new instance and behaves consistently, e.g., it cannot
   * return null if it previously returned non-null.
   *
