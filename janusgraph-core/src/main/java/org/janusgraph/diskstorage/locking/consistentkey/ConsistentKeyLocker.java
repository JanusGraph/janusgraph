/**
 * A global {@link Locker} that resolves inter-thread lock contention via
 * {@link AbstractLocker} and resolves inter-process contention by reading and
 * writing lock data using {@link KeyColumnValueStore}.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Protocol and internals</h2>
 * <p>
 * Locking is done in two stages: first between threads inside a shared process,
 * and then between processes in a JanusGraph cluster.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Inter-thread lock contention</h3>
 * <p>
 * Lock contention between transactions within a shared process is arbitrated by
 * the {@code LocalLockMediator} class. This mediator uses standard
 * {@code java.util.concurrent} classes to guarantee that at most one thread
 * holds a lock on any given {@link KeyColumn} at any given time. The code that
 * uses a mediator to resolve inter-thread lock contention is common to multiple
 * {@code Locker} implementations and lives in the abstract base class
 * {@link AbstractLocker}.
 * <p>
 * However, the mediator has no way to perform inter-process communication. The
 * mediator can't detect or prevent a thread in another process (potentially on
 * different machine) acquiring the same lock. This is addressed in the next
 * section.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Inter-process lock contention</h3>
 * <p>
 * After the mediator signals that the current transaction has obtained a lock
 * at the inter-thread/intra-process level, this implementation does the
 * following series of writes and reads to {@code KeyColumnValueStore} to check
 * whether it is the only process that holds the lock. These Cassandra
 * operations go to a dedicated store holding nothing but locking data (a
 * "store" in this context means a Cassandra column family, an HBase table,
 * etc.)
 * <p>
 * <h4>Locking I/O sequence</h4>
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Write a single column to the store with the following data
 * <dl>
 * <dt>key</dt>
 * <dd>{@link KeyColumn#getKey()} followed by {@link KeyColumn#getColumn()}.</dd>
 * <dt>column</dt>
 * <dd>the approximate current timestamp in nanoseconds followed by this
 * process's {@code rid} (an opaque identifier which uniquely identify
 * this process either globally or at least within the JanusGraph cluster)</dd>
 * <dt>value</dt>
 * <dd>the single byte 0; this is unused but reserved for future use</dd>
 * </dl>
 * </li>
 * <li>If the write failed or took longer than {@code lockWait} to complete
 * successfully, then retry the write with an updated timestamp and everything
 * else the same until we either exceed the configured retry count (in which
 * case we abort the lock attempt) or successfully complete the write in less
 * than {@code lockWait}.</li>
 * <li>Wait, if necessary, until the time interval {@code lockWait} has passed
 * between the timestamp on our successful write and the current time.</li>
 * <li>Read all columns for the key we wrote in the first step.</li>
 * <li>Discard any columns with timestamps older than {@code lockExpire}.</li>
 * <li>If our column is either the first column read or is preceeded only by
 * columns containing our own {@code rid}, then we hold the lock.  Otherwise,
 * another process holds the lock and we have failed to acquire it.</li>
 * <li>To release the lock, we delete from the store the column that we
 * wrote earlier in this sequence</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * As mentioned earlier, this class relies on {@link AbstractLocker} to obtain
 * and release an intra-process lock before and after the sequence of steps
 * listed above.  The mediator step is necessary for thread-safety, because
 * {@code rid} is only unique at the process level.  Without a mediator, distinct
 * threads could write lock columns with the same {@code rid} and be unable to
 * tell their lock claims apart.

     *
     * -------------------------------------
     * | 8 bytes timestamp | var bytes rid |
     * -------------------------------------
     *
     * A start bound of a single zero byte will always sort before the
     * smallest timestamp due to length.
     *
     * The end bound is not as obvious.  A timestamp with all-one-bits
     * is eons away in the default configuration.  However, it's theoretically
     * possible with the nanos provider, since it relies on System.nanoTime,
     * and the contract for nanoTime explicitly says that it may go negative.
     *
     * Fortunately, we can rely on the rid for our end bound.  The rid is a
     * user-customizable string that gets converted into a StaticBuffer via
     * String.getBytes.  This should UTF-8 encode it.  Under UTF-8, a byte
     * with all bits set is illegal.  So, the 9th byte of a lock column
     * should never have all bits set.  This is why LOCK_END_COL is exactly
     * 9 bytes long: it's just enough to extend past the timestamp and onto
     * the first byte of a UTF-8 string, and that UTF-8 byte should have at
     * least one zero bit that makes it sort before.

         * Both exceptions below shouldn't happen under normal operation with a
         * sane configuration. When they are thrown, they have one of two likely
         * root causes:
         *
         * 1. Due to a problem with this locker's store configuration or the
         * store itself, this locker's store "lost" a write. Specifically, a
         * column previously added to the store by writeLock(...) was not
         * returned on a subsequent read by checkLocks(...). The precise root
         * cause is store-specific. With Cassandra, for instance, this problem
         * could arise if the locker is configured to talk to Cassandra at a
         * consistency level below QUORUM.
         *
         * 2. One of our previously written locks has already expired by the
         * time we tried to read it.
         *
         * There might be additional causes that haven't occurred to me, but
         * these two seem most likely.
